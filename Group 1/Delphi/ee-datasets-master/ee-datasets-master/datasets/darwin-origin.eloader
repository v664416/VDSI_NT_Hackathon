VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.\r\n\r\n Causes of Variability--Effects of Habit and the use and disuse of\r\n Parts--Correlated Variation--Inheritance--Character of Domestic\r\n Varieties--Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and\r\n Species--Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species--Domestic\r\n Pigeons, their Differences and Origin--Principles of Selection,\r\n anciently followed, their Effects--Methodical and Unconscious\r\n Selection--Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions--Circumstances\r\n favourable to Man's power of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of\r\nour older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which\r\nstrikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do\r\nthe individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. And\r\nif we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have\r\nbeen cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most\r\ndifferent climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this\r\ngreat variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised\r\nunder conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,\r\nthose to which the parent species had been exposed under nature. There\r\nis, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that\r\nthis variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems\r\nclear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to\r\nnew conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when\r\nthe organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying\r\nfor many generations. No case is on record of a variable organism\r\nceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such\r\nas wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are\r\nstill capable of rapid improvement or modification.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the\r\nconditions of life appear to act in two ways--directly on the whole\r\norganisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the\r\nreproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in\r\nmind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted,\r\nand as I have incidently shown in my work on \"Variation under\r\nDomestication,\" there are two factors: namely, the nature of the\r\norganism and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much\r\nthe more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under,\r\nas far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand,\r\ndissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be\r\nnearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in\r\ndefinite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the\r\noffspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several\r\ngenerations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely difficult\r\nto come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which\r\nhave been thus definitely induced. There can, however, be little doubt\r\nabout many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food,\r\ncolour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from\r\nclimate, etc. Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage\r\nof our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause\r\nwere to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many\r\nindividuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such\r\nfacts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably\r\nfollow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing\r\ninsect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of\r\nplants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap.\r\n\r\nIn definite variability is a much more common result of changed\r\nconditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more\r\nimportant part in the formation of our domestic races. We see in\r\ndefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be\r\naccounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote\r\nancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the\r\nyoung of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule.\r\nAt long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the\r\nsame country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so\r\nstrongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but\r\nmonstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter\r\nvariations. All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or\r\nstrongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together,\r\nmay be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life\r\non each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill\r\neffects different men in an in definite manner, according to their\r\nstate of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or\r\ninflammation of various organs.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed\r\nconditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected,\r\nwe may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of\r\nthis system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions,\r\nand partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked,\r\nbetween the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct\r\nspecies, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when\r\nreared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how\r\neminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes\r\nin the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an\r\nanimal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely\r\nunder confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals\r\nthere are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in\r\ntheir native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to\r\nvitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour,\r\nand yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered\r\nthat a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some\r\nparticular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will\r\nproduce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and\r\nelsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular\r\nthe laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under\r\nconfinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the\r\ntropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with\r\nthe exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce\r\nyoung; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly\r\never lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless,\r\nin the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one\r\nhand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and\r\nsickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand,\r\nwe see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly\r\ntamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous\r\ninstances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected\r\nby unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at\r\nthis system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly,\r\nand producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that\r\nas some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for\r\ninstance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their\r\nreproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals\r\nand plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very\r\nslightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with\r\nthe act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I\r\nhave given in another work a long list of \"sporting plants;\" as they are\r\ncalled by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a\r\nsingle bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that\r\nof the other buds on the same plant. These bud variations, as they may\r\nbe named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, etc., and sometimes\r\nby seed. They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under\r\nculture. As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year\r\non the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to\r\nassume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing\r\nunder different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same\r\nvariety--for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and\r\nbuds on common roses producing moss-roses--we clearly see that the\r\nnature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison\r\nwith the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of\r\nvariation; perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark,\r\nby which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the\r\nnature of the flames.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF HABIT AND OF THE USE OR DISUSE OF PARTS; CORRELATED\r\nVARIATION; INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nChanged habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the\r\nflowering of plants when transported from one climate to another. With\r\nanimals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked\r\ninfluence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing\r\nweigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole\r\nskeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may\r\nbe safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking\r\nmore, than its wild parents. The great and inherited development of the\r\nudders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked,\r\nin comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another\r\ninstance of the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be\r\nnamed which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which\r\nhas been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of\r\nthe ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.\r\n\r\nMany laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and\r\nwill hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only allude to what may\r\nbe called correlated variation. Important changes in the embryo or larva\r\nwill probably entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities,\r\nthe correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many\r\ninstances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this\r\nsubject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied\r\nby an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical;\r\nthus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally\r\ndeaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is confined to\r\nthe males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which\r\nmany remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants. From\r\nfacts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs\r\nare injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape:\r\nProfessor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of\r\nthis fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their\r\npigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root\r\n(Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and which caused\r\nthe hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and one of the\r\n\"crackers\" (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, \"we select the black members\r\nof a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living.\"\r\nHairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired\r\nanimals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons\r\nwith feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with\r\nshort beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence\r\nif man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will\r\nalmost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure,\r\nowing to the mysterious laws of correlation.\r\n\r\nThe results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood laws of\r\nvariation are infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while\r\ncarefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated\r\nplants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.; and it\r\nis really surprising to note the endless points of structure and\r\nconstitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly\r\nfrom each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,\r\nand departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.\r\n\r\nAny variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the\r\nnumber and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both\r\nthose of slight and those of considerable physiological importance,\r\nare endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the\r\nfullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is\r\nthe tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental\r\nbelief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical\r\nwriters. When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it\r\nin the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the\r\nsame cause having acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently\r\nexposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some\r\nextraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say,\r\nonce among several million individuals--and it reappears in the\r\nchild, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute\r\nits reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of\r\nalbinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members\r\nof the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are\r\ntruly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\r\nadmitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole\r\nsubject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever\r\nas the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.\r\n\r\nThe laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one\r\ncan say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same\r\nspecies, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes\r\nnot so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its\r\ngrandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is\r\noften transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone,\r\nmore commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of\r\nsome importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our\r\ndomestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much\r\ngreater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I\r\nthink may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity\r\nfirst appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding\r\nage, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be\r\notherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could\r\nappear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the\r\nsilk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon\r\nstage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe\r\nthat the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent\r\nreason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that\r\nit does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it\r\nfirst appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest\r\nimportance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of\r\ncourse confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not\r\nto the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male\r\nelement; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns\r\nin the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though\r\nappearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to\r\na statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic\r\nvarieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character\r\nto their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions\r\ncan be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I\r\nhave in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above\r\nstatement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great\r\ndifficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many\r\nof the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live\r\nin a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock\r\nwas, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion\r\nhad ensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of\r\nintercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in\r\nits new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally\r\nrevert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me\r\nnot improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to\r\ncultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance,\r\nof the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some\r\neffect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of the poor\r\nsoil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the\r\nwild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is\r\nnot of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment\r\nitself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our\r\ndomestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is,\r\nto lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions\r\nand while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might\r\ncheck, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure,\r\nin such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic\r\nvarieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence\r\nin favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart\r\nand race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various\r\nbreeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations,\r\nwould be opposed to all experience.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES; DIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN\r\nVARIETIES AND SPECIES; ORIGIN OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES FROM ONE OR MORE\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\nWhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic\r\nanimals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we\r\ngenerally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less\r\nuniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often\r\nhave a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although\r\ndiffering from each other and from other species of the same genus, in\r\nseveral trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in\r\nsome one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially\r\nwhen compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest\r\nallied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of\r\nvarieties when crossed--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic\r\nraces of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as\r\ndo the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature,\r\nbut the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must be\r\nadmitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have\r\nbeen ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally\r\ndistinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties.\r\nIf any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a\r\nspecies, this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur. It has\r\noften been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in\r\ncharacters of generic value. It can be shown that this statement is not\r\ncorrect; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are\r\nof generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. When\r\nit is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that\r\nwe have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference\r\nin our domesticated races.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between\r\nallied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing\r\nwhether they are descended from one or several parent species. This\r\npoint, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for\r\ninstance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,\r\nspaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were\r\nthe offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great\r\nweight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely\r\nallied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting the\r\ndifferent quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently\r\nsee, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of\r\nthe dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a small\r\npart of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct\r\nspecies. In the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated\r\nspecies, there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are\r\ndescended from a single wild stock.\r\n\r\nIt has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals\r\nand plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and\r\nlikewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these\r\ncapacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated\r\nproductions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed\r\nan animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether\r\nit would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass\r\nand goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer,\r\nor of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I\r\ncannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our\r\ndomesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and\r\ncountries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed\r\nfor an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on\r\nan average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing\r\ndomesticated productions have varied.\r\n\r\nIn the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants,\r\nit is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are\r\ndescended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied\r\non by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals\r\nis, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt,\r\nand in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the\r\nbreeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are\r\neven identical with, those still existing. But this only throws far\r\nbackward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were\r\ndomesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed.\r\nThe lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat\r\nand barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed\r\nseveral domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with other\r\nnations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at\r\nthis early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again\r\nimplies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation,\r\nduring which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in\r\ndifferent districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct races.\r\nSince the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many\r\nparts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at\r\nan enormously remote period; and we know that at the present day there\r\nis hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nThe origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain\r\nvague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the\r\nwhole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts,\r\ncome to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidae have been\r\ntamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in\r\nthe veins of our domestic breeds. In regard to sheep and goats I can\r\nform no decided opinion. From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth,\r\non the habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian\r\ncattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different\r\naboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges\r\nbelieve that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors,\r\nwhether or not these deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as\r\nwell as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common\r\ncattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable\r\nresearches of Professor Rutimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons\r\nwhich I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in\r\nopposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same\r\nspecies. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive,\r\nhaving bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears\r\nto me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian\r\nfowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and\r\nof others who have studied this bird in India. In regard to ducks and\r\nrabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence\r\nis clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\r\naboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some\r\nauthors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the\r\ndistinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype.\r\nAt this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild\r\ncattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several\r\neven within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly\r\nexisted eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we\r\nbear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France\r\nbut few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain,\r\netc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds\r\nof cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds must\r\nhave originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been\r\nderived? So it is in India. Even in the case of the breeds of the\r\ndomestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from\r\nseveral wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an\r\nimmense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals\r\nclosely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog,\r\npug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever\r\nexisted in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all\r\nour races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few\r\naboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree\r\nintermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several\r\ndomestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of\r\nthe most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog,\r\netc., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct\r\nraces by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record\r\nshowing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided\r\nby the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired\r\ncharacter; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct\r\nraces would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented\r\nwith this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross between\r\ntwo pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with\r\npigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple\r\nenough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several\r\ngenerations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of\r\nthe task becomes manifest.\r\n\r\nBREEDS OF THE DOMESTIC PIGEON, THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nBelieving that it is always best to study some special group, I have,\r\nafter deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed\r\nwhich I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured\r\nwith skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the\r\nHon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many\r\ntreatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and\r\nsome of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I\r\nhave associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted\r\nto join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is\r\nsomething astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced\r\ntumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing\r\ncorresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially\r\nthe male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the\r\ncarunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly\r\nelongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a\r\nwide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost\r\nlike that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited\r\nhabit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in\r\nthe air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long,\r\nmassive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very\r\nlong necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short\r\ntails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak,\r\nhas a very short and broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body,\r\nwings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in\r\ninflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit\r\nhas a short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the\r\nbreast; and it has the habit of continually expanding, slightly, the\r\nupper part of the oesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much\r\nreversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it\r\nhas, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail feathers. The\r\ntrumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different\r\ncoo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty\r\ntail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all\r\nthe members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded\r\nand are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the\r\noil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might be\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nIn the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of\r\nthe face, in length and breadth and curvature, differs enormously. The\r\nshape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw,\r\nvaries in a highly remarkable manner. The caudal and sacral vertebrae\r\nvary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their\r\nrelative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of\r\nthe apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree\r\nof divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The\r\nproportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the\r\neyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in\r\nstrict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and\r\nof the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of\r\nthe oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the\r\nrelative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body;\r\nthe relative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellae on\r\nthe toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of\r\nstructure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is\r\nacquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling\r\nbirds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The\r\nmanner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and disposition, differ\r\nremarkably. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come\r\nto differ in a slight degree from each other.\r\n\r\nAltogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown\r\nto an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would\r\ncertainly be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not\r\nbelieve that any ornithologist would in this case place the English\r\ncarrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and\r\nfantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds\r\nseveral truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them,\r\ncould be shown him.\r\n\r\nGreat as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am\r\nfully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct,\r\nnamely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia),\r\nincluding under this term several geographical races or sub-species,\r\nwhich differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several\r\nof the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree\r\napplicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several\r\nbreeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon,\r\nthey must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks;\r\nfor it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing\r\nof any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced\r\nby crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the\r\ncharacteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all\r\nhave been rock-pigeons, that is, they did not breed or willingly perch\r\non trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only\r\ntwo or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have\r\nnot any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed\r\naboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they\r\nwere originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and\r\nthis, considering their size, habits and remarkable characters, seems\r\nimprobable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But\r\nbirds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely to be\r\nexterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with\r\nthe domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the\r\nsmaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the\r\nsupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with\r\nthe rock-pigeon seems a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several\r\nabove-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of\r\nthe world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back\r\nagain into their native country; but not one has become wild or feral,\r\nthough the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly\r\naltered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all recent\r\nexperience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed\r\nfreely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin\r\nof our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species\r\nwere so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man,\r\nas to be quite prolific under confinement.\r\n\r\nAn argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is,\r\nthat the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild\r\nrock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts\r\nof their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we\r\nmay look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak\r\nlike that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or\r\nbarb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like\r\nthat of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. Hence\r\nit must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in\r\nthoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or\r\nby chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that\r\nthese very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many\r\nstrange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nSome facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\r\nconsideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins;\r\nbut the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, has this\r\npart bluish. The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers\r\nexternally edged at the base with white. The wings have two black bars.\r\nSome semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides the\r\ntwo black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do\r\nnot occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in\r\nevery one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all\r\nthe above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers,\r\nsometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when birds belonging to\r\ntwo or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have\r\nany of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt\r\nsuddenly to acquire these characters. To give one instance out of\r\nseveral which I have observed: I crossed some white fantails, which\r\nbreed very true, with some black barbs--and it so happens that blue\r\nvarieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in\r\nEngland; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled. I also crossed\r\na barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot\r\non the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very true; the mongrels\r\nwere dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails\r\nwith a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a bird of as beautiful a\r\nblue colour, with the white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and\r\nwhite-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand\r\nthese facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral\r\ncharacters, if all the domestic breeds are descended from the\r\nrock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following\r\nhighly improbable suppositions. Either, first, that all the several\r\nimagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the\r\nrock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and\r\nmarked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to\r\nrevert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each\r\nbreed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score,\r\nof generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen\r\nor twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants\r\nreverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number\r\nof generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency\r\nto revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally\r\nbecome less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be\r\nless of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross, and there\r\nis a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost\r\nduring some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to\r\nthe contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite\r\nnumber of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often\r\nconfounded together by those who have written on inheritance.\r\n\r\nLastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the\r\npigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations,\r\npurposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, hardly any cases\r\nhave been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct\r\nspecies of animals being perfectly fertile. Some authors believe\r\nthat long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to\r\nsterility in species. From the history of the dog, and of some other\r\ndomestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied\r\nto species closely related to each other. But to extend it so far as to\r\nsuppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers,\r\npouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile,\r\ninter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.\r\n\r\nFrom these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having\r\nformerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely\r\nunder domestication--these supposed species being quite unknown in a\r\nwild state, and their not having become anywhere feral--these species\r\npresenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other\r\nColumbidae, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects--the\r\noccasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in\r\nall the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed--and lastly, the\r\nmongrel offspring being perfectly fertile--from these several reasons,\r\ntaken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are\r\ndescended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical\r\nsub-species.\r\n\r\nIn favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C. livia has\r\nbeen found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it\r\nagrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all\r\nthe domestic breeds. Secondly, that although an English carrier or a\r\nshort-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the\r\nrock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two\r\nraces, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can\r\nmake, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so\r\nwe can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds. Thirdly,\r\nthose characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each\r\neminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of\r\nthe carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of\r\ntail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be\r\nobvious when we treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched\r\nand tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have\r\nbeen domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the\r\nworld; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Aegyptian\r\ndynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius;\r\nbut Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in\r\nthe previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny,\r\nimmense prices were given for pigeons; \"nay, they are come to this pass,\r\nthat they can reckon up their pedigree and race.\" Pigeons were much\r\nvalued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than\r\n20,000 pigeons were taken with the court. \"The monarchs of Iran and\r\nTuran sent him some very rare birds;\" and, continues the courtly\r\nhistorian, \"His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method was never\r\npractised before, has improved them astonishingly.\" About this same\r\nperiod the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The\r\nparamount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense\r\namount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will likewise be\r\nobvious when we treat of selection. We shall then, also, see how it is\r\nthat the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character.\r\nIt is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct\r\nbreeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and\r\nthus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.\r\n\r\nI have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some,\r\nyet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and\r\nwatched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I\r\nfelt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been\r\ndomesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any\r\nnaturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the\r\nmany species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature. One\r\ncircumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders of\r\nthe various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom\r\nI have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced\r\nthat the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended\r\nfrom so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a\r\ncelebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have\r\ndescended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock, and he\r\nwill laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck,\r\nor rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was\r\ndescended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears\r\nand apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts,\r\nfor instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded\r\nfrom the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be\r\ngiven. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study\r\nthey are strongly impressed with the differences between the several\r\nraces; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for\r\nthey win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they\r\nignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight\r\ndifferences accumulated during many successive generations. May not\r\nthose naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than\r\ndoes the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate\r\nlinks in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic\r\nraces are descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson\r\nof caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature\r\nbeing lineal descendants of other species?\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF SELECTION ANCIENTLY FOLLOWED, AND THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been\r\nproduced, either from one or from several allied species. Some effect\r\nmay be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external\r\nconditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who\r\nwould account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and\r\nrace-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.\r\nOne of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we\r\nsee in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good,\r\nbut to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably\r\narisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe\r\nthat the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by\r\nany mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and\r\nthis amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has\r\nprobably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been\r\nthe case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and\r\nrace-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted\r\neither for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one\r\nbreed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another\r\npurpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man\r\nin different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in\r\nbattle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with \"everlasting\r\nlayers\" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and\r\nelegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard,\r\nand flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different\r\nseasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we\r\nmust, I think, look further than to mere variability. We can not suppose\r\nthat all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as\r\nwe now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been\r\ntheir history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature\r\ngives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions\r\nuseful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made for himself\r\nuseful breeds.\r\n\r\nThe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.\r\nIt is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a\r\nsingle lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle\r\nand sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost\r\nnecessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject,\r\nand to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal's\r\norganisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they\r\nplease. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect\r\nfrom highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better\r\nacquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other\r\nindividual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of\r\nthe principle of selection as \"that which enables the agriculturist, not\r\nonly to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether.\r\nIt is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life\r\nwhatever form and mould he pleases.\" Lord Somerville, speaking of\r\nwhat breeders have done for sheep, says: \"It would seem as if they had\r\nchalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it\r\nexistence.\" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in\r\nregard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a\r\ntrade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture\r\nby a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and\r\nthe sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may\r\nultimately be selected for breeding.\r\n\r\nWhat English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\r\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been\r\nexported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no\r\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders\r\nare strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely\r\nallied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection\r\nis far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection\r\nconsisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding\r\nfrom it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth\r\nnotice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by\r\nthe accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of\r\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences\r\nwhich I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in\r\na thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an\r\neminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his\r\nsubject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable\r\nperseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he\r\nwants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily\r\nbelieve in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to\r\nbecome even a skilful pigeon-fancier.\r\n\r\nThe same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations\r\nare here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest\r\nproductions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal\r\nstock. We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which\r\nexact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance,\r\nthe steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted.\r\nWe see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the\r\nflowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only\r\ntwenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well\r\nestablished, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but\r\nmerely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the \"rogues,\" as they call\r\nthe plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind\r\nof selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so\r\ncareless as to breed from his worst animals.\r\n\r\nIn regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated\r\neffects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in\r\nthe different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the\r\ndiversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the\r\nkitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties;\r\nand the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in\r\ncomparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See\r\nhow different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the\r\nflowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the\r\nleaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ\r\nin size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very\r\nslight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely\r\nin some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly\r\never--I speak after careful observation--perhaps never, the case. The\r\nlaw of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be\r\noverlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it\r\ncannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations,\r\neither in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races\r\ndiffering from each other chiefly in these characters.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\r\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;\r\nit has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises\r\nhave been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a\r\ncorresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from\r\ntrue that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several\r\nreferences to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of\r\nthe principle is acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English\r\nhistory choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to\r\nprevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain\r\nsize was ordered, and this may be compared to the \"roguing\" of plants\r\nby nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an\r\nancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of\r\nthe Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that\r\nthe colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.\r\nSavages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to\r\nimprove the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages\r\nin Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by\r\ncolour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone\r\nstates that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the\r\ninterior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these\r\nfacts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of\r\ndomestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now\r\nattended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange\r\nfact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of\r\ngood and bad qualities is so obvious.\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUS SELECTION.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with\r\na distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior\r\nto anything of the kind in the country. But, for our purpose, a form of\r\nselection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every\r\none trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is\r\nmore important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries\r\nto get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best\r\ndogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the\r\nbreed. Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during\r\ncenturies, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as\r\nBakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more\r\nmethodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms\r\nand qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind\r\ncould never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings\r\nof the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for\r\ncomparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed,\r\nindividuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where\r\nthe breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that King\r\nCharles' spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent\r\nsince the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are\r\nconvinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and\r\nhas probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English\r\npointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this\r\ncase the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses\r\nwith the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been\r\neffected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that,\r\nthough the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow\r\nhas not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our\r\npointer.\r\n\r\nBy a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English\r\nrace-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs,\r\nso that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are\r\nfavoured in the weights which they carry. Lord Spencer and others have\r\nshown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early\r\nmaturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By\r\ncomparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former\r\nand present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India,\r\nand Persia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly\r\npassed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nYouatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\r\nselection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the\r\nbreeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the\r\nresult which ensued--namely, the production of the distinct strains. The\r\ntwo flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as\r\nMr. Youatt remarks, \"Have been purely bred from the original stock\r\nof Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion\r\nexisting in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that\r\nthe owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the\r\npure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the\r\nsheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the\r\nappearance of being quite different varieties.\"\r\n\r\nIf there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\r\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal\r\nparticularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully\r\npreserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are\r\nso liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more\r\noffspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a\r\nkind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals\r\neven by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and\r\ndevouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than\r\ntheir dogs.\r\n\r\nIn plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional\r\npreservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently\r\ndistinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties,\r\nand whether or not two or more species or races have become blended\r\ntogether by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size\r\nand beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose,\r\npelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older\r\nvarieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get\r\na first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one\r\nwould expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild\r\npear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it\r\nhad come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical\r\ntimes, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very\r\ninferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural\r\nworks at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such\r\nsplendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple,\r\nand, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost\r\nunconsciously. It has consisted in always cultivating the best known\r\nvariety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced\r\nto appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the gardeners of the\r\nclassical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could\r\nprocure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we\r\nowe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally\r\nchosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.\r\n\r\nA large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated,\r\nexplains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases\r\nwe cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks\r\nof the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and\r\nkitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to\r\nimprove or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of\r\nusefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia,\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite\r\nuncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is\r\nnot that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance\r\npossess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native\r\nplants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard\r\nof perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries\r\nanciently civilised.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should\r\nnot be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their\r\nown food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very\r\ndifferently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having\r\nslightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed\r\nbetter in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of\r\n\"natural selection,\" as will hereafter be more fully explained, two\r\nsub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains why the\r\nvarieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors,\r\nhave more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in\r\ncivilised countries.\r\n\r\nOn the view here given of the important part which selection by man has\r\nplayed, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races\r\nshow adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants\r\nor fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal\r\ncharacter of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so\r\ngreat in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts\r\nor organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any\r\ndeviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and\r\nindeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by\r\nselection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some\r\nslight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till he\r\nsaw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual\r\nmanner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual\r\nsize; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first\r\nappeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use\r\nsuch an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in\r\nmost cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon\r\nwith a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of\r\nthat pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and\r\npartly methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails\r\nhad only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java\r\nfantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as\r\nmany as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first\r\npouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now\r\ndoes the upper part of its oesophagus--a habit which is disregarded by\r\nall fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.\r\n\r\nNor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would\r\nbe necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small\r\ndifferences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however\r\nslight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly\r\nhave been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same\r\nspecies, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after\r\nseveral breeds have fairly been established. It is known that with\r\npigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are\r\nrejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in\r\neach breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties;\r\nhence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour,\r\nthat most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct\r\nat our poultry-shows.\r\n\r\nThese views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely,\r\nthat we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our\r\ndomestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,\r\ncan hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and breeds\r\nfrom an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes\r\nmore care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves\r\nthem, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name,\r\nand from being only slightly valued, their history will have been\r\ndisregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,\r\nthey will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something\r\ndistinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial\r\nname. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the\r\nspreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the\r\npoints of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called\r\nit, of unconscious selection will always tend--perhaps more at one\r\nperiod than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion--perhaps\r\nmore in one district than in another, according to the state of\r\ncivilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic\r\nfeatures of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be\r\ninfinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow,\r\nvarying, and insensible changes.\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO MAN'S POWER OF SELECTION.\r\n\r\nI will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the\r\nreverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is\r\nobviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to\r\nwork on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient,\r\nwith extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount\r\nof modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations\r\nmanifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the\r\nchance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of\r\nindividuals being kept. Hence number is of the highest importance for\r\nsuccess. On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect\r\nto the sheep of part of Yorkshire, \"As they generally belong to poor\r\npeople, and are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be improved.\" On\r\nthe other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant,\r\nare generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and\r\nvaluable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or\r\nplant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are\r\nfavourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to\r\nbreed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent\r\nselection. But probably the most important element is that the animal or\r\nplant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is\r\npaid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure.\r\nUnless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it\r\ngravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began\r\nto vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant. No doubt the\r\nstrawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight\r\nvarieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out\r\nindividual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and\r\nraised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and\r\nbred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species)\r\nthose many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have\r\nappeared during the last half-century.\r\n\r\nWith animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element\r\nin the formation of new races--at least, in a country which is already\r\nstocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a\r\npart. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess\r\nmore than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life,\r\nand this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may\r\nbe improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this\r\ncircumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds.\r\nPigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very\r\nquick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed\r\nthey serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal\r\nrambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued\r\nby women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such\r\nbreeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other\r\ncountry. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less\r\nthan others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat,\r\nthe donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part\r\nto selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the\r\ndifficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by\r\npoor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently\r\nin certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been\r\nsurprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks,\r\nfrom not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese,\r\nfrom being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more\r\nespecially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct\r\nbreeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when\r\ndomesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though\r\nit has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described.\r\n\r\nSome authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our\r\ndomestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be\r\nexceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been\r\nattained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have\r\nbeen greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this\r\nimplies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters\r\nnow increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed\r\nfor many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt,\r\nas Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last\r\nreached. For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any\r\nterrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to\r\nbe overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of\r\ncontraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the\r\ndomestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost\r\nevery character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do\r\nthe distinct species of the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nhas proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and\r\nprobably with the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which\r\ndepends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and\r\na dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species\r\nbelonging to the same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different\r\nvarieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the\r\nseeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families.\r\nThe same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several\r\nvarieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well\r\nas in many other analogous cases.\r\n\r\nTo sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants.\r\nChanged conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing\r\nvariability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and\r\nindirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not probable\r\nthat variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all\r\ncircumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion\r\ndetermine whether variations shall endure. Variability is governed\r\nby many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most\r\nimportant. Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to\r\nthe definite action of the conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great,\r\neffect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts. The\r\nfinal result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the\r\nintercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played\r\nan important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have\r\nonce been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with\r\nthe aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation\r\nof new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much\r\nexaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are\r\npropagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily propagated by\r\ncuttings, buds, etc., the importance of crossing is immense; for the\r\ncultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids\r\nand of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated\r\nby seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only\r\ntemporary. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of\r\nselection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously\r\nand slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"II","numeral":"II","title":" VARIATION UNDER NATURE.","text":"CHAPTER II. VARIATION UNDER NATURE.\r\n\r\n Variability--Individual differences--Doubtful species--Wide ranging,\r\n much diffused, and common species, vary most--Species of the larger\r\n genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the\r\n smaller genera--Many of the species of the larger genera resemble\r\n varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other,\r\n and in having restricted ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic\r\nbeings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these\r\nlatter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject properly, a\r\nlong catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these I shall reserve\r\nfor a future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions\r\nwhich have been given of the term species. No one definition has\r\nsatisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what\r\nhe means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the\r\nunknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term \"variety\" is\r\nalmost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is\r\nalmost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also\r\nwhat are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a\r\nmonstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure,\r\ngenerally injurious, or not useful to the species. Some authors use\r\nthe term \"variation\" in a technical sense, as implying a modification\r\ndirectly due to the physical conditions of life; and \"variations\" in\r\nthis sense are supposed not to be inherited; but who can say that the\r\ndwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or\r\ndwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from\r\nfar northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few\r\ngenerations? And in this case I presume that the form would be called a\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of\r\nstructure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions, more\r\nespecially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a state\r\nof nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully\r\nrelated to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable\r\nthat any part should have been suddenly produced perfect, as that a\r\ncomplex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state.\r\nUnder domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal\r\nstructures in widely different animals. Thus pigs have occasionally been\r\nborn with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild species of the same genus\r\nhad naturally possessed a proboscis, it might have been argued that this\r\nhad appeared as a monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to find, after\r\ndiligent search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in\r\nnearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the question. If monstrous\r\nforms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature and are capable\r\nof reproduction (which is not always the case), as they occur rarely\r\nand singly, their preservation would depend on unusually favourable\r\ncircumstances. They would, also, during the first and succeeding\r\ngenerations cross with the ordinary form, and thus their abnormal\r\ncharacter would almost inevitably be lost. But I shall have to return\r\nin a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of single or\r\noccasional variations.\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.\r\n\r\nThe many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the\r\nsame parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being\r\nobserved in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same\r\nconfined locality, may be called individual differences. No one supposes\r\nthat all the individuals of the same species are cast in the same actual\r\nmould. These individual differences are of the highest importance for\r\nus, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar to every one;\r\nand they thus afford materials for natural selection to act on and\r\naccumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction\r\nindividual differences in his domesticated productions. These individual\r\ndifferences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant\r\nparts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts, that parts\r\nwhich must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or\r\nclassificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the\r\nsame species. I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist\r\nwould be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in\r\nimportant parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority,\r\nas I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered\r\nthat systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability\r\nin important characters, and that there are not many men who will\r\nlaboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in\r\nmany specimens of the same species. It would never have been expected\r\nthat the branching of the main nerves close to the great central\r\nganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species;\r\nit might have been thought that changes of this nature could have been\r\neffected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J. Lubbock has shown a degree of\r\nvariability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may almost be compared\r\nto the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. This philosophical\r\nnaturalist, I may add, has also shown that the muscles in the larvae\r\nof certain insects are far from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a\r\ncircle when they state that important organs never vary; for these\r\nsame authors practically rank those parts as important (as some few\r\nnaturalists have honestly confessed) which do not vary; and, under\r\nthis point of view, no instance will ever be found of an important part\r\nvarying; but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nThere is one point connected with individual differences which is\r\nextremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called\r\n\"protean\" or \"polymorphic,\" in which species present an inordinate\r\namount of variation. With respect to many of these forms, hardly two\r\nnaturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties. We\r\nmay instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among plants, several genera of\r\ninsects, and of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some\r\nof the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which\r\nare polymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions,\r\npolymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod\r\nshells, at former periods of time. These facts are very perplexing, for\r\nthey seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the\r\nconditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in\r\nsome of these polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or\r\ndisservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized\r\non and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of the same species often present, as is known to every one,\r\ngreat differences of structure, independently of variation, as in the\r\ntwo sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes of sterile\r\nfemales or workers among insects, and in the immature and larval states\r\nof many of the lower animals. There are, also, cases of dimorphism and\r\ntrimorphism, both with animals and plants. Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has\r\nlately called attention to the subject, has shown that the females of\r\ncertain species of butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly\r\nappear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not\r\nconnected by intermediate varieties. Fritz Muller has described\r\nanalogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain\r\nBrazilian Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs\r\nunder two distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently shaped\r\npincers, and the other has antennae much more abundantly furnished with\r\nsmelling-hairs. Although in most of these cases, the two or three forms,\r\nboth with animals and plants, are not now connected by intermediate\r\ngradations, it is possible that they were once thus connected. Mr.\r\nWallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly which presents in\r\nthe same island a great range of varieties connected by intermediate\r\nlinks, and the extreme links of the chain closely resemble the two forms\r\nof an allied dimorphic species inhabiting another part of the Malay\r\nArchipelago. Thus also with ants, the several worker-castes are\r\ngenerally quite distinct; but in some cases, as we shall hereafter see,\r\nthe castes are connected together by finely graduated varieties. So it\r\nis, as I have myself observed, with some dimorphic plants. It certainly\r\nat first appears a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly\r\nshould have the power of producing at the same time three distinct\r\nfemale forms and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce\r\nfrom the same seed-capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing\r\nthree different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds\r\nof males. Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common\r\nfact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes\r\ndiffer from each other in a wonderful manner.\r\n\r\nDOUBTFUL SPECIES.\r\n\r\nThe forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of\r\nspecies, but which are so closely similar to other forms, or are so\r\nclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do\r\nnot like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the\r\nmost important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of\r\nthese doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their\r\ncharacters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good\r\nand true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite by means of\r\nintermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a variety of the\r\nother, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described\r\nas the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great\r\ndifficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise in deciding\r\nwhether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when\r\nthey are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly\r\nassumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always remove the\r\ndifficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety\r\nof another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found,\r\nbut because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do\r\nnow somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door\r\nfor the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.\r\n\r\nHence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or\r\na variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide\r\nexperience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many\r\ncases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and\r\nwell-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species\r\nby at least some competent judges.\r\n\r\nThat varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be\r\ndisputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France, or\r\nof the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what\r\na surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good\r\nspecies, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I\r\nlie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for\r\nme 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but\r\nwhich have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this\r\nlist he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have\r\nbeen ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted\r\nseveral highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most\r\npolymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham\r\ngives only 112--a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Among animals which\r\nunite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms,\r\nranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can\r\nrarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated\r\nareas. How many of the birds and insects in North America and Europe,\r\nwhich differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one\r\neminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties,\r\nor, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr. Wallace, in\r\nseveral valuable papers on the various animals, especially on the\r\nLepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan Archipelago,\r\nshows that they may be classed under four heads, namely, as variable\r\nforms, as local forms, as geographical races or sub-species, and as true\r\nrepresentative species. The first or variable forms vary much within the\r\nlimits of the same island. The local forms are moderately constant and\r\ndistinct in each separate island; but when all from the several islands\r\nare compared together, the differences are seen to be so slight and\r\ngraduated that it is impossible to define or describe them, though\r\nat the same time the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct. The\r\ngeographical races or sub-species are local forms completely fixed and\r\nisolated; but as they do not differ from each other by strongly marked\r\nand important characters, \"There is no possible test but individual\r\nopinion to determine which of them shall be considered as species and\r\nwhich as varieties.\" Lastly, representative species fill the same\r\nplace in the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and\r\nsub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a greater\r\namount of difference than that between the local forms and sub-species,\r\nthey are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true species.\r\nNevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be given by which\r\nvariable forms, local forms, sub species and representative species can\r\nbe recognised.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds\r\nfrom the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,\r\none with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was\r\nmuch struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between\r\nspecies and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira group there\r\nare many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's\r\nadmirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as distinct species\r\nby many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally\r\nregarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some\r\nzoologists. Several experienced ornithologists consider our British red\r\ngrouse as only a strongly marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas\r\nthe greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great\r\nBritain. A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads\r\nmany naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it\r\nhas been well asked, will suffice if that between America and Europe\r\nis ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or Madeira, or the\r\nCanaries, or between the several islets of these small archipelagos, be\r\nsufficient?\r\n\r\nMr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, has\r\ndescribed what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species.\r\nMost vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one\r\ngroup of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not\r\nin consequence vary. In several cases, however, insects found living on\r\ndifferent plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their\r\nlarval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant\r\ndifferences in colour, size, or in the nature of their secretions.\r\nIn some instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and\r\nfemales, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the\r\ndifferences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and\r\nall ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good\r\nspecies. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can do so\r\nfor himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called species\r\nand which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed\r\nwould freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have\r\nlost this power, as species. As the differences depend on the insects\r\nhaving long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that\r\nintermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.\r\nThe naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank\r\ndoubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily occurs\r\nwith closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or\r\nislands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the\r\nsame continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and\r\npresents different forms in the different areas, there is always a\r\ngood chance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will link\r\ntogether the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nSome few naturalists maintain that animals never present varieties; but\r\nthen these same naturalists rank the slightest difference as of specific\r\nvalue; and when the same identical form is met with in two distant\r\ncountries, or in two geological formations, they believe that two\r\ndistinct species are hidden under the same dress. The term species thus\r\ncomes to be a mere useless abstraction, implying and assuming a separate\r\nact of creation. It is certain that many forms, considered by highly\r\ncompetent judges to be varieties, resemble species so completely in\r\ncharacter that they have been thus ranked by other highly competent\r\njudges. But to discuss whether they ought to be called species or\r\nvarieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally\r\naccepted, is vainly to beat the air.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well\r\ndeserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from\r\ngeographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc., have\r\nbeen brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank; but space\r\ndoes not here permit me to discuss them. Close investigation, in many\r\ncases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful\r\nforms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries\r\nthat we find the greatest number of them. I have been struck with the\r\nfact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful\r\nto man, or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of\r\nit will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover,\r\nwill often be ranked by some authors as species. Look at the common oak,\r\nhow closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a\r\ndozen species out of forms, which are almost universally considered\r\nby other botanists to be varieties; and in this country the highest\r\nbotanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the\r\nsessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or\r\nmere varieties.\r\n\r\nI may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A. de\r\nCandolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more ample\r\nmaterials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked on\r\nthem with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail all the many\r\npoints of structure which vary in the several species, and estimates\r\nnumerically the relative frequency of the variations. He specifies above\r\na dozen characters which may be found varying even on the same branch,\r\nsometimes according to age or development, sometimes without any\r\nassignable reason. Such characters are not of course of specific value,\r\nbut they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir,\r\nsuch as generally enter into specific definitions. De Candolle then goes\r\non to say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by\r\ncharacters never varying on the same tree, and never found connected\r\nby intermediate states. After this discussion, the result of so much\r\nlabour, he emphatically remarks: \"They are mistaken, who repeat that the\r\ngreater part of our species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful\r\nspecies are in a feeble minority. This seemed to be true, so long as\r\na genus was imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few\r\nspecimens, that is to say, were provisional. Just as we come to know\r\nthem better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific\r\nlimits augment.\" He also adds that it is the best known species which\r\npresent the greatest number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties.\r\nThus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting\r\nsix, are clustered round three sub-species, namely Q. pedunculata,\r\nsessiliflora and pubescens. The forms which connect these three\r\nsub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if\r\nthese connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally extinct\r\nthe three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other\r\nas do the four or five provisionally admitted species which closely\r\nsurround the typical Quercus robur. Finally, De Candolle admits that\r\nout of the 300 species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus\r\nas belonging to the oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional\r\nspecies, that is, are not known strictly to fulfil the definition above\r\ngiven of a true species. It should be added that De Candolle no longer\r\nbelieves that species are immutable creations, but concludes that the\r\nderivative theory is the most natural one, \"and the most accordant with\r\nthe known facts in palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of\r\nanatomical structure and classification.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms\r\nquite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in determining what\r\ndifferences to consider as specific and what as varietal; for he knows\r\nnothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is\r\nsubject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some\r\nvariation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one\r\ncountry he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful\r\nforms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will\r\nbecome impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded\r\nto, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually\r\nstudying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation\r\nin other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first\r\nimpressions. As he extends the range of his observations he will meet\r\nwith more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of\r\nclosely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended he\r\nwill in the end generally be able to make up his own mind; but he will\r\nsucceed in this at the expense of admitting much variation, and the\r\ntruth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists.\r\nWhen he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now\r\ncontinuous, in which case he cannot hope to find intermediate links,\r\nhe will be compelled to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his\r\ndifficulties will rise to a climax.\r\n\r\nCertainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between\r\nspecies and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some\r\nnaturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank of\r\nspecies; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or\r\nbetween lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences\r\nblend into each other by an insensible series; and a series impresses\r\nthe mind with the idea of an actual passage.\r\n\r\nHence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the\r\nsystematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first\r\nstep towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording\r\nin works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any\r\ndegree more distinct and permanent, as steps toward more strongly marked\r\nand permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species,\r\nand then to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another\r\nmay, in many cases, be the simple result of the nature of the organism\r\nand of the different physical conditions to which it has long been\r\nexposed; but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters,\r\nthe passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely\r\nattributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter\r\nto be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse\r\nof parts. A well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient\r\nspecies; but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the\r\nweight of the various facts and considerations to be given throughout\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nIt need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species attain\r\nthe rank of species. They may become extinct, or they may endure as\r\nvarieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr.\r\nWollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira,\r\nand with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a variety were to flourish so\r\nas to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the\r\nspecies, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant\r\nand exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both\r\nrank as independent species. But we shall hereafter return to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species\r\nas one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set\r\nof individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not\r\nessentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less\r\ndistinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again,\r\nin comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied\r\narbitrarily, for convenience sake.\r\n\r\nWIDE-RANGING, MUCH DIFFUSED, AND COMMON SPECIES VARY MOST.\r\n\r\nGuided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting\r\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\r\nspecies which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several\r\nwell-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.C.\r\nWatson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance\r\non this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as\r\ndid subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve for\r\na future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables of\r\nthe proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me\r\nto add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined\r\nthe tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well\r\nestablished. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here\r\nis with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be\r\navoided to the \"struggle for existence,\" \"divergence of character,\" and\r\nother questions, hereafter to be discussed.\r\n\r\nAlphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have\r\nvery wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been\r\nexpected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as\r\nthey come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far\r\nmore important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But\r\nmy tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which\r\nare the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species\r\nwhich are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a\r\ndifferent consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from\r\ncommonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to\r\nhave been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the most flourishing,\r\nor, as they may be called, the dominant species--those which range\r\nwidely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most\r\nnumerous in individuals--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties,\r\nor, as I consider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have\r\nbeen anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree\r\npermanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of\r\nthe country, the species which are already dominant will be the most\r\nlikely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified,\r\nstill inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become\r\ndominant over their compatriots. In these remarks on predominence, it\r\nshould be understood that reference is made only to the forms which come\r\ninto competition with each other, and more especially to the members\r\nof the same genus or class having nearly similar habits of life. With\r\nrespect to the number of individuals or commonness of species, the\r\ncomparison of course relates only to the members of the same group. One\r\nof the higher plants may be said to be dominant if it be more numerous\r\nin individuals and more widely diffused than the other plants of the\r\nsame country, which live under nearly the same conditions. A plant of\r\nthis kind is not the less dominant because some conferva inhabiting\r\nthe water or some parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in\r\nindividuals, and more widely diffused. But if the conferva or parasitic\r\nfungus exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then be\r\ndominant within its own class.\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF THE LARGER GENERA IN EACH COUNTRY VARY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN\r\nTHE SPECIES OF THE SMALLER GENERA.\r\n\r\nIf the plants inhabiting a country as described in any Flora, be divided\r\ninto two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (i.e., those\r\nincluding many species) being placed on one side, and all those in the\r\nsmaller genera on the other side, the former will be found to include a\r\nsomewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant\r\nspecies. This might have been anticipated, for the mere fact of many\r\nspecies of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there\r\nis something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country\r\nfavourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to\r\nhave found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a\r\nlarger proportional number of dominant species. But so many causes tend\r\nto obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a\r\nsmall majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here allude\r\nto only two causes of obscurity. Fresh water and salt-loving plants\r\ngenerally have very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to\r\nbe connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has\r\nlittle or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species\r\nbelong. Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally\r\nmuch more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here\r\nagain there is no close relation to the size of the genera. The cause of\r\nlowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter\r\non Geographical Distribution.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined\r\nvarieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera\r\nin each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the\r\nsmaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e., species\r\nof the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species\r\nought, as a general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees\r\ngrow, we expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have\r\nbeen formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable\r\nfor variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would\r\ngenerally still be favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we\r\nlook at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent\r\nreason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species,\r\nthan in one having few.\r\n\r\nTo test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of\r\ntwelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into\r\ntwo nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,\r\nand those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably\r\nproved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the\r\nside of the larger genera presented varieties, than on the side of the\r\nsmaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large genera which present\r\nany varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties\r\nthan do the species of the small genera. Both these results follow when\r\nanother division is made, and when all the least genera, with from only\r\none to four species, are altogether excluded from the tables. These\r\nfacts are of plain signification on the view that species are only\r\nstrongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of\r\nthe same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression,\r\nthe manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find\r\nthe manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason\r\nto believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.\r\nAnd this certainly holds true if varieties be looked at as incipient\r\nspecies; for my tables clearly show, as a general rule, that, wherever\r\nmany species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus\r\npresent a number of varieties, that is, of incipient species, beyond the\r\naverage. It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are\r\nthus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera\r\nare now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have\r\nbeen fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small\r\ngenera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size;\r\nand that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and\r\ndisappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many species of a\r\ngenus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this\r\ncertainly holds good.\r\n\r\nMANY OF THE SPECIES INCLUDED WITHIN THE LARGER GENERA RESEMBLE VARIETIES\r\nIN BEING VERY CLOSELY, BUT UNEQUALLY, RELATED TO EACH OTHER, AND IN\r\nHAVING RESTRICTED RANGES.\r\n\r\nThere are other relations between the species of large genera and their\r\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no\r\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked\r\nvarieties; and when intermediate links have not been found between\r\ndoubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by\r\nthe amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not\r\nthe amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. Hence\r\nthe amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling\r\nwhether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. Now Fries\r\nhas remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to insects,\r\nthat in large genera the amount of difference between the species is\r\noften exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this numerically by\r\naverages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view.\r\nI have also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers,\r\nand, after deliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect,\r\ntherefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more\r\nthan do the species of the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in\r\nanother way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a\r\nnumber of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are\r\nnow manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a\r\ncertain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a\r\nless than the usual amount of difference.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each other, in\r\nthe same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to\r\neach other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are\r\nequally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into\r\nsub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked,\r\nlittle groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around\r\nother species. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally\r\nrelated to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round\r\ntheir parent-species. Undoubtedly there is one most important point of\r\ndifference between varieties and species, namely, that the amount of\r\ndifference between varieties, when compared with each other or with\r\ntheir parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the\r\nsame genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of\r\ndivergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and\r\nhow the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase into the\r\ngreater differences between species.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which is worth notice. Varieties generally have\r\nmuch restricted ranges. This statement is indeed scarcely more than a\r\ntruism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of\r\nits supposed parent-species, their denominations would be reversed.\r\nBut there is reason to believe that the species which are very closely\r\nallied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have\r\nmuch restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H.C. Watson has marked for me\r\nin the well-sifted London catalogue of Plants (4th edition) sixty-three\r\nplants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as\r\nso closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these\r\nsixty-three reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the\r\nprovinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this\r\nsame catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged varieties are recorded, and\r\nthese range over 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these\r\nvarieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. So that the acknowledged\r\nvarieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have\r\nthe closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful\r\nspecies, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as\r\ngood and true species.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nFinally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species--except, first,\r\nby the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and, secondly, by a\r\ncertain indefinite amount of difference between them; for two forms,\r\nif differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,\r\nnotwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected; but the amount\r\nof difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of\r\nspecies cannot be defined. In genera having more than the average number\r\nof species in any country, the species of these genera have more than\r\nthe average number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to\r\nbe closely but unequally allied together, forming little clusters round\r\nother species. Species very closely allied to other species apparently\r\nhave restricted ranges. In all these respects the species of large\r\ngenera present a strong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly\r\nunderstand these analogies, if species once existed as varieties, and\r\nthus originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if\r\nspecies are independent creations.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species\r\nof the larger genera within each class which on an average yield the\r\ngreatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall hereafter see,\r\ntend to become converted into new and distinct species. Thus the larger\r\ngenera tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life\r\nwhich are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving\r\nmany modified and dominant descendants. But, by steps hereafter to be\r\nexplained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.\r\nAnd thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into\r\ngroups subordinate to groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"III","numeral":"III","title":" STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.","text":"CHAPTER III. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.\r\n\r\n Its bearing on natural selection--The term used in a wide\r\n sense--Geometrical ratio of increase--Rapid increase of naturalised\r\n animals and plants--Nature of the checks to increase--Competition\r\n universal--Effects of climate--Protection from the number of\r\n individuals--Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout\r\n nature--Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties\r\n of the same species: often severe between species of the same genus--The\r\n relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a few\r\npreliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on\r\nnatural selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that\r\namong organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual\r\nvariability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.\r\nIt is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called\r\nspecies or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or\r\nthree hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,\r\nif the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the\r\nmere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked\r\nvarieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but\r\nlittle in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those\r\nexquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,\r\nand to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being,\r\nbeen perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in\r\nthe woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less plainly in the\r\nhumblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers\r\nof a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water;\r\nin the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we\r\nsee beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called\r\nincipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct\r\nspecies, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far\r\nmore than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups\r\nof species, which constitute what are called distinct genera and which\r\ndiffer from each other more than do the species of the same genus,\r\narise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next\r\nchapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle,\r\nvariations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they\r\nbe in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their\r\ninfinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their\r\nphysical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such\r\nindividuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring. The\r\noffspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of\r\nthe many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a\r\nsmall number can survive. I have called this principle, by which\r\neach slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural\r\nselection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.\r\nBut the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of\r\nthe Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. We\r\nhave seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and\r\ncan adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of\r\nslight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But\r\nNatural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready\r\nfor action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as\r\nthe works of Nature are to those of Art.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.\r\nIn my future work this subject will be treated, as it well deserves,\r\nat greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and\r\nphilosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\r\ncompetition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with\r\nmore spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently\r\nthe result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than\r\nto admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or\r\nmore difficult--at least I found it so--than constantly to bear this\r\nconclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind,\r\nthe whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity,\r\nabundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite\r\nmisunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we\r\noften see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget that the\r\nbirds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds,\r\nand are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these\r\nsongsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and\r\nbeasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food may be\r\nnow superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.\r\n\r\nTHE TERM, STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE, USED IN A LARGE SENSE.\r\n\r\nI should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense,\r\nincluding dependence of one being on another, and including (which is\r\nmore important) not only the life of the individual, but success in\r\nleaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth, may be truly\r\nsaid to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a\r\nplant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the\r\ndrought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the\r\nmoisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which\r\nonly one of an average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to\r\nstruggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already\r\nclothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few\r\nother trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle\r\nwith these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same\r\ntree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling mistletoes, growing\r\nclose together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle\r\nwith each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its\r\nexistence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle\r\nwith other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and\r\nthus disseminate its seeds. In these several senses, which pass into\r\neach other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for\r\nExistence.\r\n\r\nGEOMETRICAL RATIO OF INCREASE.\r\n\r\nA struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which\r\nall organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its\r\nnatural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction\r\nduring some period of its life, and during some season or occasional\r\nyear, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers\r\nwould quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support\r\nthe product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly\r\nsurvive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either\r\none individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals\r\nof distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the\r\ndoctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase\r\nof food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some\r\nspecies may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all\r\ncannot do so, for the world would not hold them.\r\n\r\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\r\nincreases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would\r\nsoon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding\r\nman has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than\r\na thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his\r\nprogeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only\r\ntwo seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their\r\nseedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there\r\nwould be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder\r\nof all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its\r\nprobable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be safest to assume\r\nthat it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding\r\ntill ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and\r\nsurviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of\r\nfrom 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants\r\nalive descended from the first pair.\r\n\r\nBut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical\r\ncalculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly\r\nrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when\r\ncircumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following\r\nseasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals\r\nof many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world; if the\r\nstatements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses\r\nin South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well\r\nauthenticated, they would have been incredible. So it is with plants;\r\ncases could be given of introduced plants which have become common\r\nthroughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. Several of\r\nthe plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the\r\ncommonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues\r\nof surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been\r\nintroduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India,\r\nas I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which\r\nhave been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and\r\nendless others could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of\r\nthe animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any\r\nsensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life\r\nhave been highly favourable, and that there has consequently been less\r\ndestruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been\r\nenabled to breed. Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result\r\nof which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their\r\nextraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces\r\nseed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair.\r\nHence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending\r\nto increase at a geometrical ratio--that all would rapidly stock every\r\nstation in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical\r\ntendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of\r\nlife. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think,\r\nto mislead us; we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do\r\nnot keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food,\r\nand that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or\r\nseeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is,\r\nthat the slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under\r\nfavourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The\r\ncondor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the\r\nsame country the condor may be the more numerous of the two. The Fulmar\r\npetrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird\r\nin the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the\r\nhippobosca, a single one. But this difference does not determine how\r\nmany individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. A\r\nlarge number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend\r\non a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase\r\nin number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is\r\nto make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period\r\nin the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any\r\nway protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and\r\nyet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are\r\ndestroyed, many must be produced or the species will become extinct. It\r\nwould suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an\r\naverage for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a\r\nthousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could\r\nbe ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so that, in all cases, the\r\naverage number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the\r\nnumber of its eggs or seeds.\r\n\r\nIn looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing\r\nconsiderations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic\r\nbeing may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers;\r\nthat each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy\r\ndestruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each\r\ngeneration or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the\r\ndestruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost\r\ninstantaneously increase to any amount.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CHECKS TO INCREASE.\r\n\r\nThe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase\r\nare most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it\r\nswarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase still further. We\r\nknow not exactly what the checks are even in a single instance. Nor will\r\nthis surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head,\r\neven in regard to mankind, although so incomparably better known than\r\nany other animal. This subject of the checks to increase has been ably\r\ntreated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss it at\r\nconsiderable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of\r\nSouth America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to\r\nthe reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals\r\nseem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With\r\nplants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some observations\r\nwhich I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer most from\r\ngerminating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants.\r\nSeedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for\r\ninstance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and\r\ncleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked\r\nall the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of 357\r\nno less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf\r\nwhich has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf\r\nclosely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants\r\ngradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of\r\ntwenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four)\r\nnine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nThe amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit\r\nto which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining\r\nfood, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the\r\naverage number of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that\r\nthe stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends\r\nchiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot\r\nduring the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no\r\nvermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game\r\nthan at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now\r\nannually shot. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant,\r\nnone are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most\r\nrarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.\r\n\r\nClimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of\r\na species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be\r\nthe most effective of all checks. I estimated (chiefly from the greatly\r\nreduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of 1854-5\r\ndestroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is\r\na tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an\r\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of\r\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for\r\nexistence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it\r\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of\r\nthe same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food.\r\nEven when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will\r\nbe the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food\r\nthrough the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we travel\r\nfrom south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably\r\nsee some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally\r\ndisappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are\r\ntempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is\r\na false view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds,\r\nis constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life,\r\nfrom enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if\r\nthese enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any\r\nslight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each\r\narea is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must\r\ndecrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in\r\nnumbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other\r\nspecies being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we\r\ntravel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of\r\nspecies of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward;\r\nhence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener\r\nmeet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of\r\nclimate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain.\r\nWhen we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute\r\ndeserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.\r\n\r\nThat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we\r\nclearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in our gardens can\r\nperfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised,\r\nfor they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by\r\nour native animals.\r\n\r\nWhen a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases\r\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this\r\nseems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue; and here\r\nwe have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even\r\nsome of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,\r\nwhich have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of\r\ndiffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured:\r\nand here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the\r\nsame species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely\r\nnecessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of\r\ncorn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great\r\nexcess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can\r\nthe birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,\r\nincrease in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their\r\nnumbers are checked during the winter; but any one who has tried knows\r\nhow troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants\r\nin a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of\r\nthe necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation,\r\nexplains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such as that of very\r\nrare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where\r\nthey do exist; and that of some social plants being social, that is\r\nabounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range. For\r\nin such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where\r\nthe conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist\r\ntogether, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I should\r\nadd that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of close\r\ninterbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases; but I\r\nwill not here enlarge on this subject.\r\n\r\nCOMPLEX RELATIONS OF ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO EACH OTHER IN THE\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.\r\n\r\nMany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the\r\nchecks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle\r\ntogether in the same country. I will give only a single instance, which,\r\nthough a simple one, interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of\r\na relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large\r\nand extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand\r\nof man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been\r\nenclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The\r\nchange in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was\r\nmost remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite\r\ndifferent soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the\r\nheath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not\r\ncounting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could\r\nnot be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have been\r\nstill greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the\r\nplantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was\r\nfrequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how\r\npotent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing\r\nwhatever else having been done, with the exception of the land having\r\nbeen enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an\r\nelement enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here\r\nthere are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on\r\nthe distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\r\nenclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so\r\nclose together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these young\r\ntrees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their\r\nnumbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine\r\nhundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not\r\nsee a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking\r\nclosely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings\r\nand little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle.\r\nIn one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of\r\nthe old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with\r\ntwenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to raise its\r\nhead above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as\r\nsoon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously\r\ngrowing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so\r\nextensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so\r\nclosely and effectually searched it for food.\r\n\r\nHere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch\r\nfir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence\r\nof cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;\r\nfor here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though\r\nthey swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and\r\nRengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay\r\nof a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals\r\nwhen first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are,\r\nmust be habitually checked by some means, probably by other parasitic\r\ninsects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in\r\nParaguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and this would\r\nlessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses\r\nwould become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed\r\nI have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again\r\nwould largely affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen\r\nin Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in\r\never-increasing circles of complexity. Not that under nature the\r\nrelations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must be\r\ncontinually recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the\r\nforces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains for long\r\nperiods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would give\r\nthe victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless, so profound\r\nis our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we\r\nhear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the\r\ncause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the\r\nduration of the forms of life!\r\n\r\nI am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals,\r\nremote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex\r\nrelations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic\r\nLobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and\r\nconsequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed. Nearly\r\nall our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects\r\nto remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I find\r\nfrom experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the\r\nfertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do\r\nnot visit this flower. I have also found that the visits of bees are\r\nnecessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance\r\ntwenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds, but\r\ntwenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one. Again, 100\r\nheads of red clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the same\r\nnumber of protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble bees alone\r\nvisit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It has been\r\nsuggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt whether they\r\ncould do so in the case of the red clover, from their weight not being\r\nsufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may infer as highly\r\nprobable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very\r\nrare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare,\r\nor wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district depends\r\nin a great measure upon the number of field-mice, which destroy their\r\ncombs and nests; and Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits\r\nof humble-bees, believes that \"more than two-thirds of them are\r\nthus destroyed all over England.\" Now the number of mice is largely\r\ndependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Colonel\r\nNewman says, \"Near villages and small towns I have found the nests\r\nof humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the\r\nnumber of cats that destroy the mice.\" Hence it is quite credible that\r\nthe presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might\r\ndetermine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the\r\nfrequency of certain flowers in that district!\r\n\r\nIn the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different\r\nperiods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come\r\ninto play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent,\r\nbut all will concur in determining the average number, or even\r\nthe existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that\r\nwidely-different checks act on the same species in different districts.\r\nWhen we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we\r\nare tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we\r\ncall chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when\r\nan American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs\r\nup; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins in the Southern\r\nUnited States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees, now\r\ndisplay the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the\r\nsurrounding virgin forests. What a struggle must have gone on during\r\nlong centuries between the several kinds of trees, each annually\r\nscattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and\r\ninsect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts\r\nof prey--all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the\r\ntrees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first\r\nclothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees. Throw up\r\na handful of feathers, and all fall to the ground according to definite\r\nlaws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to\r\nthat of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals\r\nwhich have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional\r\nnumbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!\r\n\r\nThe dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its\r\nprey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This\r\nis likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to\r\nstruggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and\r\ngrass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will almost invariably\r\nbe most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they\r\nfrequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed\r\nto the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the\r\nstruggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see\r\nthe contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be\r\nsown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which\r\nbest suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will\r\nbeat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few\r\nyears supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even\r\nsuch extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas,\r\nthey must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed\r\nin due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in\r\nnumber and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has\r\nbeen asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other\r\nmountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same\r\nresult has followed from keeping together different varieties of the\r\nmedicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any\r\nof our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength,\r\nhabits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed\r\nstock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen\r\ngenerations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same\r\nmanner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not\r\nannually preserved in due proportion.\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR LIFE MOST SEVERE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND VARIETIES OF THE\r\nSAME SPECIES.\r\n\r\nAs the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means\r\ninvariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in\r\nstructure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if\r\nthey come into competition with each other, than between the species of\r\ndistinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the\r\nUnited States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of\r\nanother species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of\r\nScotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we\r\nhear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under\r\nthe most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach\r\nhas everywhere driven before it its great congener. In Australia the\r\nimported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native\r\nbee. One species of charlock has been known to supplant another species;\r\nand so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be\r\nmost severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in\r\nthe economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely\r\nsay why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nA corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing\r\nremarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related,\r\nin the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other\r\norganic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or\r\nresidence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This\r\nis obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in\r\nthat of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on\r\nthe tiger's body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion,\r\nand in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation\r\nseems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the\r\nadvantage of the plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation\r\nto the land being already thickly clothed with other plants; so that the\r\nseeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the\r\nwater-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving,\r\nallows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own\r\nprey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.\r\n\r\nThe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at\r\nfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the\r\nstrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and\r\nbeans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that\r\nthe chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of\r\nthe seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously\r\nall around.\r\n\r\nLook at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not double or\r\nquadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a\r\nlittle more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges\r\ninto slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case\r\nwe can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give the plant the\r\npower of increasing in numbers, we should have to give it some advantage\r\nover its competitors, or over the animals which prey on it. On the\r\nconfines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with\r\nrespect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we\r\nhave reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far,\r\nthat they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate. Not\r\nuntil we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic regions or on\r\nthe borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land may be\r\nextremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few\r\nspecies, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest\r\nor dampest spots.\r\n\r\nHence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country,\r\namong new competitors, the conditions of its life will generally be\r\nchanged in an essential manner, although the climate may be exactly the\r\nsame as in its former home. If its average numbers are to increase in\r\nits new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we\r\nshould have had to do in its native country; for we should have to give\r\nit some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is good thus to try in imagination to give any one species an\r\nadvantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know\r\nwhat to do. This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the mutual\r\nrelations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it is\r\ndifficult to acquire. All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind\r\nthat each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio;\r\nthat each, at some period of its life, during some season of the year,\r\nduring each generation, or at intervals, has to struggle for life and\r\nto suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may\r\nconsole ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not\r\nincessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and\r\nthat the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Can the principle of selection,\r\nwhich we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature?\r\nI think we shall see that it can act most efficiently. Let the endless\r\nnumber of slight variations and individual differences occurring in our\r\ndomestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in those under nature, be\r\nborne in mind; as well as the strength of the hereditary tendency. Under\r\ndomestication, it may truly be said that the whole organisation becomes\r\nin some degree plastic. But the variability, which we almost universally\r\nmeet with in our domestic productions is not directly produced, as\r\nHooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by man; he can neither originate\r\nvarieties nor prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve and\r\naccumulate such as do occur. Unintentionally he exposes organic beings\r\nto new and changing conditions of life, and variability ensues; but\r\nsimilar changes of conditions might and do occur under nature. Let it\r\nalso be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are\r\nthe mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their\r\nphysical conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied\r\ndiversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing\r\nconditions of life. Can it then be thought improbable, seeing that\r\nvariations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other\r\nvariations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex\r\nbattle of life, should occur in the course of many successive\r\ngenerations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more\r\nindividuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having\r\nany advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance\r\nof surviving and procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel\r\nsure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly\r\ndestroyed. This preservation of favourable individual differences and\r\nvariations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have\r\ncalled Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest. Variations\r\nneither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection,\r\nand would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in\r\ncertain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to\r\nthe nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural\r\nSelection. Some have even imagined that natural selection induces\r\nvariability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such variations\r\nas arise and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life.\r\nNo one objects to agriculturists speaking of the potent effects of man's\r\nselection; and in this case the individual differences given by nature,\r\nwhich man for some object selects, must of necessity first occur. Others\r\nhave objected that the term selection implies conscious choice in the\r\nanimals which become modified; and it has even been urged that, as\r\nplants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them!\r\nIn the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a\r\nfalse term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective\r\naffinities of the various elements?--and yet an acid cannot strictly be\r\nsaid to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It has been\r\nsaid that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but\r\nwho objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling\r\nthe movements of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is\r\nimplied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary\r\nfor brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word\r\nNature; but I mean by nature, only the aggregate action and product of\r\nmany natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained\r\nby us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by\r\ntaking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change, for\r\ninstance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants will\r\nalmost immediately undergo a change, and some species will probably\r\nbecome extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate\r\nand complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are\r\nbound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of the\r\ninhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would\r\nseriously affect the others. If the country were open on its borders,\r\nnew forms would certainly immigrate, and this would likewise seriously\r\ndisturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be\r\nremembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or\r\nmammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a\r\ncountry partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted\r\nforms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy\r\nof nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the\r\noriginal inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area\r\nbeen open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on\r\nby intruders. In such cases, slight modifications, which in any way\r\nfavoured the individuals of any species, by better adapting them to\r\ntheir altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural\r\nselection would have free scope for the work of improvement.\r\n\r\nWe have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter,\r\nthat changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased\r\nvariability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and\r\nthis would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by affording\r\na better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations. Unless such\r\noccur, natural selection can do nothing. Under the term of \"variations,\"\r\nit must never be forgotten that mere individual differences are\r\nincluded. As man can produce a great result with his domestic animals\r\nand plants by adding up in any given direction individual differences,\r\nso could natural selection, but far more easily from having incomparably\r\nlonger time for action. Nor do I believe that any great physical change,\r\nas of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation, to check immigration,\r\nis necessary in order that new and unoccupied places should be left\r\nfor natural selection to fill up by improving some of the varying\r\ninhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling\r\ntogether with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in\r\nthe structure or habits of one species would often give it an advantage\r\nover others; and still further modifications of the same kind would\r\noften still further increase the advantage, as long as the species\r\ncontinued under the same conditions of life and profited by similar\r\nmeans of subsistence and defence. No country can be named in which all\r\nthe native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to\r\nthe physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could\r\nbe still better adapted or improved; for in all countries, the natives\r\nhave been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have\r\nallowed some foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as\r\nforeigners have thus in every country beaten some of the natives, we\r\nmay safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with\r\nadvantage, so as to have better resisted the intruders.\r\n\r\nAs man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his\r\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural\r\nselection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters:\r\nNature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or\r\nsurvival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far\r\nas they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ,\r\non every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of\r\nlife. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the\r\nbeing which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by\r\nher, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives\r\nof many climates in the same country. He seldom exercises each selected\r\ncharacter in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a\r\nshort-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed\r\nor long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep\r\nwith long and short wool to the same climate; does not allow the most\r\nvigorous males to struggle for the females; he does not rigidly destroy\r\nall inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as\r\nlies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection\r\nby some half-monstrous form, or at least by some modification prominent\r\nenough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature,\r\nthe slightest differences of structure or constitution may well turn the\r\nnicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved.\r\nHow fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short his time,\r\nand consequently how poor will be his results, compared with those\r\naccumulated by Nature during whole geological periods! Can we wonder,\r\nthen, that Nature's productions should be far \"truer\" in character than\r\nman's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the\r\nmost complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of\r\nfar higher workmanship?\r\n\r\nIt may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly\r\nscrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting\r\nthose that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently\r\nand insensibly working, WHENEVER AND WHEREVER OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, at\r\nthe improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in\r\nprogress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and\r\nthen so imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages that we see\r\nonly that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nIn order that any great amount of modification should be effected in a\r\nspecies, a variety, when once formed must again, perhaps after a long\r\ninterval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same\r\nfavourable nature as before; and these must again be preserved, and so\r\nonward, step by step. Seeing that individual differences of the\r\nsame kind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an\r\nunwarrantable assumption. But whether it is true, we can judge only\r\nby seeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general\r\nphenomena of nature. On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the\r\namount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity, is likewise\r\na simple assumption.\r\n\r\nAlthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of each\r\nbeing, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of\r\nvery trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating\r\ninsects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white\r\nin winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, we must believe that\r\nthese tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them\r\nfrom danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives,\r\nwould increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely\r\nfrom birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so\r\nmuch so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep\r\nwhite pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence natural\r\nselection might be effective in giving the proper colour to each kind\r\nof grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and\r\nconstant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an\r\nanimal of any particular colour would produce little effect; we should\r\nremember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy a lamb\r\nwith the faintest trace of black. We have seen how the colour of hogs,\r\nwhich feed on the \"paint-root\" in Virginia, determines whether they\r\nshall live or die. In plants, the down on the fruit and the colour of\r\nthe flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling\r\nimportance; yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing,\r\nthat in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a\r\nbeetle, a Curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far\r\nmore from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease\r\nattacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured\r\nflesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a\r\ngreat difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a\r\nstate of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees\r\nand with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle\r\nwhich variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed\r\nfruit, should succeed.\r\n\r\nIn looking at many small points of difference between species, which,\r\nas far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we\r\nmust not forget that climate, food, etc., have no doubt produced some\r\ndirect effect. It is also necessary to bear in mind that, owing to\r\nthe law of correlation, when one part varies and the variations are\r\naccumulated through natural selection, other modifications, often of the\r\nmost unexpected nature, will ensue.\r\n\r\nAs we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at\r\nany particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the\r\nsame period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds\r\nof the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the\r\ncaterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the\r\neggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the\r\nhorns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature\r\nnatural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at\r\nany age, by the accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and\r\nby their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to\r\nhave its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see\r\nno greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection,\r\nthan in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the\r\ndown in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify\r\nand adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly\r\ndifferent from those which concern the mature insect; and these\r\nmodifications may affect, through correlation, the structure of the\r\nadult. So, conversely, modifications in the adult may affect the\r\nstructure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure\r\nthat they shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the species would\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\nNatural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to\r\nthe parent and of the parent in relation to the young. In social animals\r\nit will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the\r\nwhole community; if the community profits by the selected change. What\r\nnatural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species,\r\nwithout giving it any advantage, for the good of another species;\r\nand though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural\r\nhistory, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation. A\r\nstructure used only once in an animal's life, if of high importance to\r\nit, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance,\r\nthe great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for\r\nopening the cocoon--or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds,\r\nused for breaking the eggs. It has been asserted, that of the best\r\nshort-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than are\r\nable to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching.\r\nNow, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short\r\nfor the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very\r\nslow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection\r\nof all the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and\r\nhardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more\r\ndelicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness\r\nof the shell being known to vary like every other structure.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be much\r\nfortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence on the\r\ncourse of natural selection. For instance, a vast number of eggs or\r\nseeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through natural\r\nselection only if they varied in some manner which protected them from\r\ntheir enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds would perhaps, if not\r\ndestroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted to their conditions\r\nof life than any of those which happened to survive. So again a vast\r\nnumber of mature animals and plants, whether or not they be the best\r\nadapted to their conditions, must be annually destroyed by accidental\r\ncauses, which would not be in the least degree mitigated by certain\r\nchanges of structure or constitution which would in other ways be\r\nbeneficial to the species. But let the destruction of the adults be ever\r\nso heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not wholly\r\nkept down by such causes--or again let the destruction of eggs or\r\nseeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are\r\ndeveloped--yet of those which do survive, the best adapted individuals,\r\nsupposing that there is any variability in a favourable direction,\r\nwill tend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less\r\nwell adapted. If the numbers be wholly kept down by the causes just\r\nindicated, as will often have been the case, natural selection will\r\nbe powerless in certain beneficial directions; but this is no valid\r\nobjection to its efficiency at other times and in other ways; for we\r\nare far from having any reason to suppose that many species ever undergo\r\nmodification and improvement at the same time in the same area.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex\r\nand become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt it will be\r\nunder nature. Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes to be\r\nmodified through natural selection in relation to different habits\r\nof life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be modified in\r\nrelation to the other sex, as commonly occurs. This leads me to say a\r\nfew words on what I have called sexual selection. This form of selection\r\ndepends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic\r\nbeings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the\r\nindividuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the\r\nother sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but\r\nfew or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than\r\nnatural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are\r\nbest fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in\r\nmany cases victory depends not so much on general vigour, but on having\r\nspecial weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless\r\ncock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring. Sexual\r\nselection, by always allowing the victor to breed, might surely give\r\nindomitable courage, length of spur, and strength to the wing to\r\nstrike in the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal\r\ncockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks. How low in the\r\nscale of nature the law of battle descends I know not; male alligators\r\nhave been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like\r\nIndians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons\r\nhave been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes\r\nbear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of certain\r\nhymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that inimitable\r\nobserver M. Fabre, fighting for a particular female who sits by, an\r\napparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and then retires\r\nwith the conqueror. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males\r\nof polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special\r\nweapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though\r\nto them and to others, special means of defence may be given through\r\nmeans of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion, and the hooked jaw\r\nto the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory as\r\nthe sword or spear.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All\r\nthose who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the\r\nseverest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by\r\nsinging, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise,\r\nand some others, congregate, and successive males display with the most\r\nelaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous plumage;\r\nthey likewise perform strange antics before the females, which, standing\r\nby as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who\r\nhave closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they\r\noften take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has\r\ndescribed how a pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen\r\nbirds. I cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if man can in a\r\nshort time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams, according\r\nto his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female\r\nbirds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious\r\nor beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce\r\na marked effect. Some well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of\r\nmale and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can\r\npartly be explained through the action of sexual selection on variations\r\noccurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to\r\nboth sexes at corresponding ages; but I have not space here to enter on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal\r\nhave the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,\r\nor ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual\r\nselection: that is, by individual males having had, in successive\r\ngenerations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,\r\nmeans of defence, or charms; which they have transmitted to their\r\nmale offspring alone. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all sexual\r\ndifferences to this agency: for we see in our domestic animals\r\npeculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex, which\r\napparently have not been augmented through selection by man. The tuft of\r\nhair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it\r\nis doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird;\r\nindeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been\r\ncalled a monstrosity.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION, OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE\r\nFITTEST.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I\r\nmust beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us\r\ntake the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some\r\nby craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose\r\nthat the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in\r\nthe country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased\r\nin numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was hardest\r\npressed for food. Under such circumstances the swiftest and slimmest\r\nwolves have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or\r\nselected, provided always that they retained strength to master their\r\nprey at this or some other period of the year, when they were compelled\r\nto prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt that\r\nthis would be the result, than that man should be able to improve the\r\nfleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by\r\nthat kind of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying to\r\nkeep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. I may\r\nadd that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf\r\ninhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a\r\nlight greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky,\r\nwith shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.\r\n\r\nEven without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on\r\nwhich our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to\r\npursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable;\r\nfor we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our\r\ndomestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another\r\nmice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game,\r\nanother hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and\r\nalmost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats\r\nrather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate\r\nchange of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would\r\nhave the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its\r\nyoung would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the\r\nrepetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would\r\neither supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again,\r\nthe wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the\r\nlowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the\r\ncontinued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites,\r\ntwo varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and\r\nblend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon\r\nhave to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two\r\nvarieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United\r\nStates, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and\r\nthe other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks\r\nthe shepherd's flocks.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of the\r\nslimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly marked\r\nvariation having been preserved. In former editions of this work I\r\nsometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently occurred.\r\nI saw the great importance of individual differences, and this led me\r\nfully to discuss the results of unconscious selection by man,\r\nwhich depends on the preservation of all the more or less valuable\r\nindividuals, and on the destruction of the worst. I saw, also, that\r\nthe preservation in a state of nature of any occasional deviation of\r\nstructure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare event; and that, if at\r\nfirst preserved, it would generally be lost by subsequent intercrossing\r\nwith ordinary individuals. Nevertheless, until reading an able and\r\nvaluable article in the \"North British Review\" (1867), I did not\r\nappreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly\r\nmarked, could be perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of\r\nanimals, producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of\r\nwhich, from various causes of destruction, only two on an average\r\nsurvive to pro-create their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate\r\nfor most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the lower\r\norganisms. He then shows that if a single individual were born, which\r\nvaried in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life as that\r\nof the other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly against its\r\nsurvival. Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that half its young\r\ninherited the favourable variation; still, as the Reviewer goes onto\r\nshow, the young would have only a slightly better chance of surviving\r\nand breeding; and this chance would go on decreasing in the succeeding\r\ngenerations. The justice of these remarks cannot, I think, be disputed.\r\nIf, for instance, a bird of some kind could procure its food more easily\r\nby having its beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly\r\ncurved, and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be\r\na very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to the\r\nexclusion of the common form; but there can hardly be a doubt, judging\r\nby what we see taking place under domestication, that this result would\r\nfollow from the preservation during many generations of a large number\r\nof individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the\r\ndestruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.\r\n\r\nIt should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly\r\nmarked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual\r\ndifferences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being\r\nsimilarly acted on--of which fact numerous instances could be given with\r\nour domestic productions. In such cases, if the varying individual did\r\nnot actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it\r\nwould undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions\r\nremained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner.\r\nThere can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same\r\nmanner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the same\r\nspecies have been similarly modified without the aid of any form of\r\nselection. Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals may\r\nhave been thus affected, of which fact several instances could be given.\r\nThus Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe\r\nIslands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was formerly ranked\r\nas a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans. In cases of this\r\nkind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature, the original form\r\nwould soon be supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of\r\nthe fittest.\r\n\r\nTo the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all kinds,\r\nI shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most animals and\r\nplants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander about;\r\nwe see this even with migratory birds, which almost always return to the\r\nsame spot. Consequently each newly-formed variety would generally be at\r\nfirst local, as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state\r\nof nature; so that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a\r\nsmall body together, and would often breed together. If the new variety\r\nwere successful in its battle for life, it would slowly spread from\r\na central district, competing with and conquering the unchanged\r\nindividuals on the margins of an ever-increasing circle.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to give another and more complex illustration of\r\nthe action of natural selection. Certain plants excrete sweet juice,\r\napparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap:\r\nthis is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in\r\nsome Leguminosae, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel.\r\nThis juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but\r\ntheir visits do not in any way benefit the plant. Now, let us suppose\r\nthat the juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of\r\na certain number of plants of any species. Insects in seeking the nectar\r\nwould get dusted with pollen, and would often transport it from one\r\nflower to another. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same\r\nspecies would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, as can be fully\r\nproved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have\r\nthe best chance of flourishing and surviving. The plants which produced\r\nflowers with the largest glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar,\r\nwould oftenest be visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed; and\r\nso in the long-run would gain the upper hand and form a local variety.\r\nThe flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in\r\nrelation to the size and habits of the particular insect which visited\r\nthem, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of the pollen, would\r\nlikewise be favoured. We might have taken the case of insects visiting\r\nflowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as\r\npollen is formed for the sole purpose of fertilisation, its destruction\r\nappears to be a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen\r\nwere carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the\r\npollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus\r\neffected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed it\r\nmight still be a great gain to the plant to be thus robbed; and the\r\nindividuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger anthers,\r\nwould be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen our plant, by the above process long continued, had been rendered\r\nhighly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part,\r\nregularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they do this\r\neffectually I could easily show by many striking facts. I will give only\r\none, as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of\r\nplants. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens\r\nproducing a rather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil;\r\nother holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized\r\npistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain\r\nof pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty\r\nyards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from\r\ndifferent branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception,\r\nthere were a few pollen-grains, and on some a profusion. As the wind had\r\nset for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could\r\nnot thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and boisterous and\r\ntherefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which\r\nI examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, which had flown\r\nfrom tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary\r\ncase; as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to\r\ninsects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another\r\nprocess might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has\r\nbeen called the \"physiological division of labour;\" hence we may believe\r\nthat it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one\r\nflower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on\r\nanother plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions\r\nof life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs\r\nbecome more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever\r\nso slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried\r\nregularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of\r\nthe sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of\r\nthe division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more\r\nincreased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a\r\ncomplete separation of the sexes might be effected. It would take up\r\ntoo much space to show the various steps, through dimorphism and other\r\nmeans, by which the separation of the sexes in plants of various kinds\r\nis apparently now in progress; but I may add that some of the species\r\nof holly in North America are, according to Asa Gray, in an exactly\r\nintermediate condition, or, as he expresses it, are more or less\r\ndioeciously polygamous.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the\r\nplant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued\r\nselection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in\r\nmain part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts showing how\r\nanxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of cutting\r\nholes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which with\r\na very little more trouble they can enter by the mouth. Bearing such\r\nfacts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances\r\nindividual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis,\r\netc., too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other\r\ninsect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their\r\nfood more quickly than others; and thus the communities to which they\r\nbelonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same\r\npeculiarities. The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate\r\nclovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance\r\nappear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar\r\nout of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which\r\nis visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover\r\noffer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.\r\nThat this nectar is much liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have\r\nrepeatedly seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the\r\nflowers through holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble bees.\r\nThe difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover,\r\nwhich determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling; for\r\nI have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers of\r\nthe second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited by many\r\nhive-bees. I do not know whether this statement is accurate; nor whether\r\nanother published statement can be trusted, namely, that the Ligurian\r\nbee, which is generally considered a mere variety of the common\r\nhive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is able to reach and suck\r\nthe nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a country where this kind of\r\nclover abounded, it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a\r\nslightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand,\r\nas the fertility of this clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the\r\nflowers, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be\r\na great advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided\r\ncorolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers.\r\nThus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either\r\nsimultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each\r\nother in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all\r\nthe individuals which presented slight deviations of structure mutually\r\nfavourable to each other.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in\r\nthe above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which\r\nwere first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on \"the modern\r\nchanges of the earth, as illustrative of geology;\" but we now seldom\r\nhear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and\r\ninsignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest\r\nvalleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural\r\nselection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small\r\ninherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and\r\nas modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a\r\ngreat valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish\r\nthe belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any\r\ngreat and sudden modification in their structure.\r\n\r\nON THE INTERCROSSING OF INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\nI must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals\r\nand plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two\r\nindividuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not well\r\nunderstood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in the\r\ncase of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless there is\r\nreason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either\r\noccasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind.\r\nThis view was long ago doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and\r\nKolreuter. We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat\r\nthe subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared\r\nfor an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects and some\r\nother large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research\r\nhas much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real\r\nhermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly\r\nunite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there\r\nare many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,\r\nand a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be\r\nasked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever\r\nconcur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I\r\nmust trust to some general considerations alone.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made\r\nso many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal\r\nbelief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between\r\ndifferent varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of\r\nanother strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the\r\nother hand, that CLOSE interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility;\r\nthat these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law\r\nof nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity\r\nof generations; but that a cross with another individual is\r\noccasionally--perhaps at long intervals of time--indispensable.\r\n\r\nOn the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand\r\nseveral large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any\r\nother view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable\r\nexposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a\r\nmultitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the\r\nweather! If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that\r\nthe plant's own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost\r\nto ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of\r\npollen from another individual will explain the above state of exposure\r\nof the organs. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of\r\nfructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or\r\npea-family; but these almost invariably present beautiful and curious\r\nadaptations in relation to the visits of insects. So necessary are the\r\nvisits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers, that their fertility is\r\ngreatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it is scarcely\r\npossible for insects to fly from flower to flower, and not to carry\r\npollen from one to the other, to the great good of the plant.\r\nInsects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient, to ensure\r\nfertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one\r\nflower and then the stigma of another; but it must not be supposed that\r\nbees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species;\r\nfor if a plant's own pollen and that from another species are placed\r\non the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it invariably and\r\ncompletely destroys, as has been shown by Gartner, the influence of the\r\nforeign pollen.\r\n\r\nWhen the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or\r\nslowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems\r\nadapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful\r\nfor this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the\r\nstamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with\r\nthe barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a special\r\ncontrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if\r\nclosely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is\r\nhardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally\r\ncross. In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being\r\nfavoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the\r\nstigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the\r\nworks of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations: for\r\ninstance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate\r\ncontrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are\r\nswept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of\r\nthat individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is\r\nnever visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed,\r\nthough by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I\r\nraise plenty of seedlings. Another species of Lobelia, which is visited\r\nby bees, seeds freely in my garden. In very many other cases, though\r\nthere is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma\r\nreceiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more\r\nrecently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either\r\nthe anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the\r\nstigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that\r\nthese so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and\r\nmust habitually be crossed. So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants previously alluded to. How strange are these facts!\r\nHow strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower,\r\nthough placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of\r\nself-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to each\r\nother! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional\r\ncross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!\r\n\r\nIf several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other\r\nplants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority of the\r\nseedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for instance, I\r\nraised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties\r\ngrowing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind,\r\nand some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each\r\ncabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by\r\nthose of the many other flowers on the same plant; and the pollen of\r\neach flower readily gets on its stigma without insect agency; for I\r\nhave found that plants carefully protected from insects produce the\r\nfull number of pods. How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the\r\nseedlings are mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct\r\nVARIETY having a prepotent effect over the flower's own pollen; and\r\nthat this is part of the general law of good being derived from the\r\nintercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When distinct\r\nSPECIES are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant's own pollen\r\nis always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall\r\nreturn in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be\r\nobjected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at\r\nmost only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on the\r\nsame tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited\r\nsense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely\r\nprovided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers\r\nwith separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although the male\r\nand female flowers may be produced on the same tree, pollen must be\r\nregularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better\r\nchance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That\r\ntrees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than\r\nother plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request\r\nDr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those\r\nof the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the\r\nother hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that the rule does not hold good in\r\nAustralia: but if most of the Australian trees are dichogamous, the same\r\nresult would follow as if they bore flowers with separated sexes. I have\r\nmade these few remarks on trees simply to call attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nTurning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial species are\r\nhermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these\r\nall pair. As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which\r\ncan fertilise itself. This remarkable fact, which offers so strong a\r\ncontrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view of an\r\noccasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of the\r\nfertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of\r\ninsects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could\r\nbe effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two\r\nindividuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising\r\nhermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious means\r\nfor an occasional cross. As in the case of flowers, I have as yet\r\nfailed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely,\r\nProfessor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal with the\r\norgans of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without,\r\nand the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can be shown to\r\nbe physically impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present,\r\nunder this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I have been\r\nenabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, though\r\nboth are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.\r\n\r\nIt must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, both\r\nwith animals and plants, some species of the same family and even of\r\nthe same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in their whole\r\norganisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual. But if, in fact,\r\nall hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference between\r\nthem and unisexual species is, as far as function is concerned, very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations and from the many special facts which\r\nI have collected, but which I am unable here to give, it appears that\r\nwith animals and plants an occasional intercross between distinct\r\nindividuals is a very general, if not universal, law of nature.\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEW FORMS THROUGH NATURAL\r\nSELECTION.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of variability,\r\nunder which term individual differences are always included, will\r\nevidently be favourable. A large number of individuals, by giving a\r\nbetter chance within any given period for the appearance of profitable\r\nvariations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each\r\nindividual, and is, I believe, a highly important element of success.\r\nThough nature grants long periods of time for the work of natural\r\nselection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic\r\nbeings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if\r\nany one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding\r\ndegree with its competitors it will be exterminated. Unless favourable\r\nvariations be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can\r\nbe effected by natural selection. The tendency to reversion may often\r\ncheck or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not prevented man\r\nfrom forming by selection numerous domestic races, why should it prevail\r\nagainst natural selection?\r\n\r\nIn the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite\r\nobject, and if the individuals be allowed freely to intercross, his work\r\nwill completely fail. But when many men, without intending to alter\r\nthe breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to\r\nprocure and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly\r\nfollows from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that\r\nthere is no separation of selected individuals. Thus it will be under\r\nnature; for within a confined area, with some place in the natural\r\npolity not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right\r\ndirection, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved.\r\nBut if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly\r\npresent different conditions of life; and then, if the same species\r\nundergoes modification in different districts, the newly formed\r\nvarieties will intercross on the confines of each. But we shall see in\r\nthe sixth chapter that intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate\r\ndistricts, will in the long run generally be supplanted by one of the\r\nadjoining varieties. Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals\r\nwhich unite for each birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a\r\nvery quick rate. Hence with animals of this nature, for instance birds,\r\nvarieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this\r\nI find to be the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only\r\noccasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth, but\r\nwhich wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and improved\r\nvariety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there\r\nmaintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals\r\nof the new variety would chiefly cross together. On this principle\r\nnurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the\r\nchance of intercrossing is thus lessened.\r\n\r\nEven with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not propagate\r\nrapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would always\r\neliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring forward\r\na considerable body of facts showing that within the same area two\r\nvarieties of the same animal may long remain distinct, from haunting\r\ndifferent stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from\r\nthe individuals of each variety preferring to pair together.\r\n\r\nIntercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the\r\nindividuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and\r\nuniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently\r\nwith those animals which unite for each birth; but, as already stated,\r\nwe have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with\r\nall animals and plants. Even if these take place only at long intervals\r\nof time, the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and\r\nfertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation,\r\nthat they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their\r\nkind; and thus in the long run the influence of crosses, even at rare\r\nintervals, will be great. With respect to organic beings extremely low\r\nin the scale, which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which\r\ncannot possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by\r\nthem under the same conditions of life, only through the principle\r\nof inheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy any\r\nindividuals departing from the proper type. If the conditions of life\r\nchange and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of character\r\ncan be given to the modified offspring, solely by natural selection\r\npreserving similar favourable variations.\r\n\r\nIsolation also is an important element in the modification of species\r\nthrough natural selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very\r\nlarge, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be\r\nalmost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all\r\nthe varying individuals of the same species in the same manner.\r\nIntercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding districts,\r\nwill also be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner has lately published an\r\ninteresting essay on this subject, and has shown that the service\r\nrendered by isolation in preventing crosses between newly-formed\r\nvarieties is probably greater even than I supposed. But from reasons\r\nalready assigned I can by no means agree with this naturalist, that\r\nmigration and isolation are necessary elements for the formation of new\r\nspecies. The importance of isolation is likewise great in preventing,\r\nafter any physical change in the conditions, such as of climate,\r\nelevation of the land, etc., the immigration of better adapted\r\norganisms; and thus new places in the natural economy of the district\r\nwill be left open to be filled up by the modification of the old\r\ninhabitants. Lastly, isolation will give time for a new variety to be\r\nimproved at a slow rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance.\r\nIf, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being\r\nsurrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical\r\nconditions, the total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this\r\nwill retard the production of new species through natural selection, by\r\ndecreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.\r\n\r\nThe mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against\r\nnatural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously asserted\r\nthat the element of time has been assumed by me to play an all-important\r\npart in modifying species, as if all the forms of life were necessarily\r\nundergoing change through some innate law. Lapse of time is only so far\r\nimportant, and its importance in this respect is great, that it gives\r\na better chance of beneficial variations arising and of their being\r\nselected, accumulated, and fixed. It likewise tends to increase the\r\ndirect action of the physical conditions of life, in relation to the\r\nconstitution of each organism.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any\r\nsmall isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the number of\r\nthe species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our chapter on\r\nGeographical Distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion\r\nare endemic,--that is, have been produced there and nowhere else in the\r\nworld. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly\r\nfavourable for the production of new species. But we may thus deceive\r\nourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large\r\nopen area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production\r\nof new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal\r\ntimes; and this we are incapable of doing.\r\n\r\nAlthough isolation is of great importance in the production of new\r\nspecies, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area\r\nis still more important, especially for the production of species which\r\nshall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading\r\nwidely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a\r\nbetter chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of\r\nindividuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of\r\nlife are much more complex from the large number of already existing\r\nspecies; and if some of these many species become modified and improved,\r\nothers will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they\r\nwill be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much\r\nimproved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and\r\nwill thus come into competition with many other forms. Moreover, great\r\nareas, though now continuous, will often, owing to former oscillations\r\nof level, have existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects\r\nof isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred.\r\nFinally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas have been in\r\nsome respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet\r\nthat the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on\r\nlarge areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on\r\nlarge areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors,\r\nwill be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the\r\ngreatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more\r\nimportant part in the changing history of the organic world.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some\r\nfacts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical\r\nDistribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the\r\nsmaller continent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger\r\nEuropaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions\r\nhave everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small\r\nisland, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will\r\nhave been less modification and less extermination. Hence, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald\r\nHeer, resembles to a certain extent the extinct tertiary flora of\r\nEurope. All fresh water basins, taken together, make a small area\r\ncompared with that of the sea or of the land. Consequently, the\r\ncompetition between fresh water productions will have been less severe\r\nthan elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly produced, and old\r\nforms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water basins that\r\nwe find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant\r\norder: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now\r\nknown in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like\r\nfossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widely separated\r\nin the natural scale. These anomalous forms may be called living\r\nfossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited\r\na confined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and\r\ntherefore less severe, competition.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits, the\r\ncircumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new\r\nspecies through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial\r\nproductions a large continental area, which has undergone many\r\noscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the\r\nproduction of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long\r\ntime and to spread widely. While the area existed as a continent the\r\ninhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will\r\nhave been subjected to severe competition. When converted by subsidence\r\ninto large separate islands there will still have existed many\r\nindividuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the\r\nconfines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after\r\nphysical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so\r\nthat new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled\r\nup by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been\r\nallowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected.\r\nWhen, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted into a\r\ncontinental area, there will again have been very severe competition;\r\nthe most favoured or improved varieties will have been enabled to\r\nspread; there will have been much extinction of the less improved forms,\r\nand the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the\r\nreunited continent will again have been changed; and again there will\r\nhave been a fair field for natural selection to improve still further\r\nthe inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.\r\n\r\nThat natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I fully\r\nadmit. It can act only when there are places in the natural polity of a\r\ndistrict which can be better occupied by the modification of some of its\r\nexisting inhabitants. The occurrence of such places will often depend\r\non physical changes, which generally take place very slowly, and on the\r\nimmigration of better adapted forms being prevented. As some few of\r\nthe old inhabitants become modified the mutual relations of others will\r\noften be disturbed; and this will create new places, ready to be filled\r\nup by better adapted forms; but all this will take place very slowly.\r\nAlthough all the individuals of the same species differ in some slight\r\ndegree from each other, it would often be long before differences of\r\nthe right nature in various parts of the organisation might occur. The\r\nresult would often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. Many will\r\nexclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient to neutralise the\r\npower of natural selection. I do not believe so. But I do believe that\r\nnatural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long intervals\r\nof time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same region. I\r\nfurther believe that these slow, intermittent results accord well with\r\nwhat geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of\r\nthe world have changed.\r\n\r\nSlow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much\r\nby artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change,\r\nto the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between all organic\r\nbeings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life,\r\nwhich may have been effected in the long course of time through nature's\r\npower of selection, that is by the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION CAUSED BY NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nThis subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but\r\nit must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with natural\r\nselection. Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of\r\nvariations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. Owing to\r\nthe high geometrical rate of increase of all organic beings, each area\r\nis already fully stocked with inhabitants, and it follows from this,\r\nthat as the favoured forms increase in number, so, generally, will the\r\nless favoured decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us,\r\nis the precursor to extinction. We can see that any form which\r\nis represented by few individuals will run a good chance of utter\r\nextinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the seasons, or\r\nfrom a temporary increase in the number of its enemies. But we may go\r\nfurther than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we admit that\r\nspecific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old\r\nforms must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not\r\nindefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently\r\nattempt to show why it is that the number of species throughout the\r\nworld has not become immeasurably great.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals\r\nhave the best chance of producing favourable variations within any given\r\nperiod. We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the second\r\nchapter, showing that it is the common and diffused or dominant species\r\nwhich offer the greatest number of recorded varieties. Hence, rare\r\nspecies will be less quickly modified or improved within any given\r\nperiod; they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the\r\nmodified and improved descendants of the commoner species.\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,\r\nthat as new species in the course of time are formed through natural\r\nselection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.\r\nThe forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing\r\nmodification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have\r\nseen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most\r\nclosely-allied forms,--varieties of the same species, and species of\r\nthe same genus or related genera,--which, from having nearly the same\r\nstructure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest\r\ncompetition with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species,\r\nduring the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest\r\non its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same\r\nprocess of extermination among our domesticated productions, through\r\nthe selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be\r\ngiven showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other animals,\r\nand varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds. In\r\nYorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were\r\ndisplaced by the long-horns, and that these \"were swept away by the\r\nshort-horns\" (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) \"as if by\r\nsome murderous pestilence.\"\r\n\r\nDIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nThe principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high\r\nimportance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In\r\nthe first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having\r\nsomewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts\r\nin many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ far less from each\r\nother than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless according to my\r\nview, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as\r\nI have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser\r\ndifference between varieties become augmented into the greater\r\ndifference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must\r\ninfer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting\r\nwell-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and\r\nparents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined\r\ndifferences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety\r\nto differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this\r\nvariety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and\r\nin a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual\r\nand large a degree of difference as that between the species of the same\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nAs has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from\r\nour domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. It\r\nwill be admitted that the production of races so different as short-horn\r\nand Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several breeds of\r\npigeons, etc., could never have been effected by the mere chance\r\naccumulation of similar variations during many successive generations.\r\nIn practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a pigeon having a\r\nslightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a\r\nrather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that \"fanciers do\r\nnot and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes,\" they\r\nboth go on (as has actually occurred with the sub-breeds of the\r\ntumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer\r\nbeaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at\r\nan early period of history, the men of one nation or district required\r\nswifter horses, while those of another required stronger and bulkier\r\nhorses. The early differences would be very slight; but, in the course\r\nof time, from the continued selection of swifter horses in the one case,\r\nand of stronger ones in the other, the differences would become greater,\r\nand would be noted as forming two sub-breeds. Ultimately after the\r\nlapse of centuries, these sub-breeds would become converted into two\r\nwell-established and distinct breeds. As the differences became greater,\r\nthe inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very\r\nswift nor very strong, would not have been used for breeding, and will\r\nthus have tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions\r\nthe action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing\r\ndifferences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and\r\nthe breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from their\r\ncommon parent.\r\n\r\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?\r\nI believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long\r\ntime before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more\r\ndiversified the descendants from any one species become in structure,\r\nconstitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to\r\nseize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and\r\nso be enabled to increase in numbers.\r\n\r\nWe can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple habits.\r\nTake the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can\r\nbe supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average.\r\nIf its natural power of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in\r\nincreasing (the country not undergoing any change in conditions) only by\r\nits varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other\r\nanimals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds\r\nof prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing\r\ntrees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous.\r\nThe more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our\r\ncarnivorous animals become, the more places they will be enabled to\r\noccupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to\r\nall animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural selection can\r\neffect nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been experimentally\r\nproved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass,\r\nand a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses,\r\na greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can be\r\nraised in the latter than in the former case. The same has been found\r\nto hold good when one variety and several mixed varieties of wheat have\r\nbeen sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass\r\nwere to go on varying, and the varieties were continually selected which\r\ndiffered from each other in the same manner, though in a very slight\r\ndegree, as do the distinct species and genera of grasses, a greater\r\nnumber of individual plants of this species, including its modified\r\ndescendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And\r\nwe know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing\r\nalmost countless seeds; and is thus striving, as it may be said, to\r\nthe utmost to increase in number. Consequently, in the course of many\r\nthousand generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species\r\nof grass would have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing\r\nin numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and\r\nvarieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be\r\nsupported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many\r\nnatural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely\r\nopen to immigration, and where the contest between individual and\r\nindividual must be very severe, we always find great diversity in its\r\ninhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by\r\nfour in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same\r\nconditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to\r\neighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants\r\ndiffered from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small\r\nand uniform islets: also in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find\r\nthat they can raise more food by a rotation of plants belonging to the\r\nmost different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous\r\nrotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any\r\nsmall piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be\r\nin any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost\r\nto live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest\r\ncompetition, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the\r\naccompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the\r\ninhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a\r\ngeneral rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's\r\nagency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants\r\nwhich would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would generally\r\nhave been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked\r\nat as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might\r\nalso, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised plants would have\r\nbelonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in\r\ntheir new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. de Candolle\r\nhas well remarked, in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by\r\nnaturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and\r\nspecies, far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single\r\ninstance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's \"Manual of the Flora of\r\nthe Northern United States,\" 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and\r\nthese belong to 162 genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants\r\nare of a highly diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large\r\nextent, from the indigenes, for out of the 162 naturalised genera,\r\nno less than 100 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large\r\nproportional addition is made to the genera now living in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBy considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any\r\ncountry struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there become\r\nnaturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the\r\nnatives would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage over\r\ntheir compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification of\r\nstructure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants of the\r\nsame region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division\r\nof labour in the organs of the same individual body--a subject so well\r\nelucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by\r\nbeing adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws\r\nmost nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of\r\nany land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are\r\ndiversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of\r\nindividuals be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of animals,\r\nwith their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete\r\nwith a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted,\r\nfor instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into\r\ngroups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as\r\nMr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and\r\nrodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-developed\r\norders. In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification\r\nin an early and incomplete stage of development.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH\r\nDIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER AND EXTINCTION, ON THE DESCENDANTS OF A COMMON\r\nANCESTOR.\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we may\r\nassume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed so\r\nmuch the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are\r\nthus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now let\r\nus see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of\r\ncharacter, combined with the principles of natural selection and of\r\nextinction, tends to act.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\r\nperplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large\r\nin its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other\r\nin unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is\r\nrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances.\r\nI have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second chapter, on\r\nan average more species vary in large genera than in small genera; and\r\nthe varying species of the large genera present a greater number of\r\nvarieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest\r\nand most widely-diffused, vary more than do the rare and restricted\r\nspecies. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species,\r\nbelonging to a genus large in its own country. The branching and\r\ndiverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may\r\nrepresent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be\r\nextremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not\r\nsupposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of\r\ntime; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only\r\nthose variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or\r\nnaturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit\r\nderived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally\r\nlead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by\r\nthe outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural\r\nselection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines,\r\nand is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of\r\nvariation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly\r\nwell-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a\r\nsystematic work.\r\n\r\nThe intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent\r\neach a thousand or more generations. After a thousand generations,\r\nspecies (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked\r\nvarieties, namely a1 and m1. These two varieties will generally still\r\nbe exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and\r\nthe tendency to variability is in itself hereditary; consequently they\r\nwill likewise tend to vary, and commonly in nearly the same manner as\r\ndid their parents. Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly\r\nmodified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their\r\nparent (A) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same\r\ncountry; they will also partake of those more general advantages which\r\nmade the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus\r\nin its own country. And all these circumstances are favourable to the\r\nproduction of new varieties.\r\n\r\nIf, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of\r\ntheir variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand\r\ngenerations. And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the\r\ndiagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle\r\nof divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a1. Variety m1 is\r\nsupposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2 and s2, differing\r\nfrom each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We\r\nmay continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some\r\nof the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only\r\na single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some\r\nproducing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus\r\nthe varieties or modified descendants of the common parent (A), will\r\ngenerally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. In the\r\ndiagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation,\r\nand under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nBut I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes\r\non so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made\r\nsomewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far more\r\nprobable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then\r\nagain undergoes modification. Nor do I suppose that the most divergent\r\nvarieties are invariably preserved: a medium form may often long endure,\r\nand may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for\r\nnatural selection will always act according to the nature of the places\r\nwhich are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings;\r\nand this will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a general\r\nrule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one\r\nspecies can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize\r\non, and the more their modified progeny will increase. In our diagram\r\nthe line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered\r\nletters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently\r\ndistinct to be recorded as varieties. But these breaks are imaginary,\r\nand might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to\r\nallow the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.\r\n\r\nAs all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused\r\nspecies, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the\r\nsame advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will\r\ngenerally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character:\r\nthis is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches\r\nproceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and more\r\nhighly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable,\r\noften take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved\r\nbranches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower\r\nbranches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some cases no\r\ndoubt the process of modification will be confined to a single line of\r\ndescent, and the number of modified descendants will not be increased;\r\nalthough the amount of divergent modification may have been augmented.\r\nThis case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines\r\nproceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a1 to a10. In the\r\nsame way the English racehorse and English pointer have apparently\r\nboth gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks,\r\nwithout either having given off any fresh branches or races.\r\n\r\nAfter ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced\r\nthree forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character\r\nduring the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but\r\nperhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we\r\nsuppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram\r\nto be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked\r\nvarieties; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of\r\nmodification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these\r\nthree forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species:\r\nthus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences\r\ndistinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences\r\ndistinguishing species. By continuing the same process for a greater\r\nnumber of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and\r\nsimplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between\r\na14 and m14, all descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are\r\nmultiplied and genera are formed.\r\n\r\nIn a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary.\r\nIn the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by\r\nanalogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked\r\nvarieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to the amount of\r\nchange supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After\r\nfourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters\r\nn14 to z14, are supposed to have been produced. In any genus, the\r\nspecies which are already very different in character from each\r\nother, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified\r\ndescendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing on new and\r\nwidely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I\r\nhave chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I),\r\nas those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties\r\nand species. The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our\r\noriginal genus, may for long but unequal periods continue to transmit\r\nunaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted\r\nlines unequally prolonged upwards.\r\n\r\nBut during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,\r\nanother of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played\r\nan important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection\r\nnecessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the\r\nstruggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in\r\nthe improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate\r\nin each stage of descent their predecessors and their original\r\nprogenitor. For it should be remembered that the competition will\r\ngenerally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly\r\nrelated to each other in habits, constitution and structure. Hence all\r\nthe intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is\r\nbetween the less and more improved states of a the same species, as well\r\nas the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become\r\nextinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of\r\ndescent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines. If,\r\nhowever, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct\r\ncountry, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which\r\noffspring and progenitor do not come into competition, both may continue\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nIf, then, our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of\r\nmodification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become\r\nextinct, being replaced by eight new species (a14 to m14); and species\r\n(I) will be replaced by six (n14 to z14) new species.\r\n\r\nBut we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were\r\nsupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally\r\nthe case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and\r\nD than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to\r\nthe others. These two species (A and I), were also supposed to be very\r\ncommon and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have\r\nhad some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. Their\r\nmodified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth\r\ngeneration, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages:\r\nthey have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at\r\neach stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related\r\nplaces in the natural economy of their country. It seems, therefore,\r\nextremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus\r\nexterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of\r\nthe original species which were most nearly related to their parents.\r\nHence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring\r\nto the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose that only one (F)\r\nof the two species (E and F) which were least closely related to the\r\nother nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late\r\nstage of descent.\r\n\r\nThe new species in our diagram, descended from the original eleven\r\nspecies, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency\r\nof natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character\r\nbetween species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the\r\nmost distinct of the original eleven species. The new species, moreover,\r\nwill be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of the eight\r\ndescendants from (A) the three marked a14, q14, p14, will be nearly\r\nrelated from having recently branched off from a10; b14 and f14, from\r\nhaving diverged at an earlier period from a5, will be in some degree\r\ndistinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o14, e14, and\r\nm14, will be nearly related one to the other, but, from having diverged\r\nat the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely\r\ndifferent from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or\r\na distinct genus.\r\n\r\nThe six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or genera. But as\r\nthe original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly\r\nat the extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)\r\nwill, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight\r\ndescendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have\r\ngone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species,\r\nalso (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the\r\noriginal species (A) and (I), have all become, except (F), extinct, and\r\nhave left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from\r\n(I), and the eight descendants from (A), will have to be ranked as very\r\ndistinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.\r\n\r\nThus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by\r\ndescent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus.\r\nAnd the two or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from\r\nsome one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram this is indicated\r\nby the broken lines beneath the capital letters, converging in\r\nsub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point represents\r\na species, the supposed progenitor of our several new sub-genera and\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new\r\nspecies F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,\r\nbut to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only\r\nin a slight degree. In this case its affinities to the other fourteen\r\nnew species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Being descended\r\nfrom a form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I),\r\nnow supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree\r\nintermediate in character between the two groups descended from these\r\ntwo species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character\r\nfrom the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will not be\r\ndirectly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two\r\ngroups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases before his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to\r\nrepresent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or\r\nmore generations; it may also represent a section of the successive\r\nstrata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall, when we\r\ncome to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject,\r\nand I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the\r\naffinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the\r\nsame orders, families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often,\r\nin some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and\r\nwe can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at various\r\nremote epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained,\r\nto the formation of genera alone. If, in the diagram, we suppose the\r\namount of change represented by each successive group of diverging\r\ndotted lines to be great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked\r\nb14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very distinct\r\ngenera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I),\r\ndiffering widely from the descendants of (A). These two groups of genera\r\nwill thus form two distinct families, or orders, according to the amount\r\nof divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And\r\nthe two new families, or orders, are descended from two species of the\r\noriginal genus; and these are supposed to be descended from some still\r\nmore ancient and unknown form.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the\r\nlarger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.\r\nThis, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts\r\nthrough one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle\r\nfor existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some\r\nadvantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have\r\ninherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the\r\nstruggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly\r\nlie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in\r\nnumber. One large group will slowly conquer another large group,\r\nreduce its number, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and\r\nimprovement. Within the same large group, the later and more highly\r\nperfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places\r\nin the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy\r\nthe earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and\r\nsub-groups will finally disappear. Looking to the future, we can predict\r\nthat the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant,\r\nand which are least broken up, that is, which have as yet suffered least\r\nextinction, will, for a long period, continue to increase. But which\r\ngroups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we know that\r\nmany groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become\r\nextinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict\r\nthat, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups,\r\na multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no\r\nmodified descendants; and consequently that, of the species living at\r\nany one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote\r\nfuturity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on\r\nclassification, but I may add that as, according to this view, extremely\r\nfew of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants to the\r\npresent day, and, as all the descendants of the same species form a\r\nclass, we can understand how it is that there exist so few classes in\r\neach main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although few of\r\nthe most ancient species have left modified descendants, yet, at remote\r\ngeological periods, the earth may have been almost as well peopled with\r\nspecies of many genera, families, orders and classes, as at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nON THE DEGREE TO WHICH ORGANISATION TENDS TO ADVANCE.\r\n\r\nNatural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation\r\nof variations, which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic\r\nconditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of life.\r\nThe ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more\r\nimproved in relation to its conditions. This improvement inevitably\r\nleads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater\r\nnumber of living beings throughout the world. But here we enter on a\r\nvery intricate subject, for naturalists have not defined to each other's\r\nsatisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation. Among the\r\nvertebrata the degree of intellect and an approach in structure to man\r\nclearly come into play. It might be thought that the amount of change\r\nwhich the various parts and organs pass through in their development\r\nfrom embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but\r\nthere are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which several\r\nparts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature animal\r\ncannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer's standard seems\r\nthe most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of\r\ndifferentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in the adult\r\nstate, as I should be inclined to add, and their specialisation\r\nfor different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would express it, the\r\ncompleteness of the division of physiological labour. But we shall see\r\nhow obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes, among\r\nwhich some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the sharks,\r\napproach nearest to amphibians; while other naturalists rank the common\r\nbony or teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch as they are most\r\nstrictly fish-like, and differ most from the other vertebrate classes.\r\nWe see still more plainly the obscurity of the subject by turning\r\nto plants, among which the standard of intellect is of course quite\r\nexcluded; and here some botanists rank those plants as highest which\r\nhave every organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and pistils, fully\r\ndeveloped in each flower; whereas other botanists, probably with more\r\ntruth, look at the plants which have their several organs much modified\r\nand reduced in number as the highest.\r\n\r\nIf we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of\r\ndifferentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being\r\nwhen adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for\r\nintellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this\r\nstandard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs,\r\ninasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is\r\nan advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of variations\r\ntending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural selection.\r\nOn the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that all organic\r\nbeings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to seize on every\r\nunoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy of nature, that\r\nit is quite possible for natural selection gradually to fit a being to\r\na situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless: in\r\nsuch cases there would be retrogression in the scale of organisation.\r\nWhether organisation on the whole has actually advanced from the\r\nremotest geological periods to the present day will be more conveniently\r\ndiscussed in our chapter on Geological Succession.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in\r\nthe scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the lowest\r\nforms still exist; and how is it that in each great class some forms\r\nare far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more highly\r\ndeveloped forms every where supplanted and exterminated the lower?\r\nLamarck, who believed in an innate and inevitable tendency towards\r\nperfection in all organic beings, seems to have felt this difficulty\r\nso strongly that he was led to suppose that new and simple forms are\r\ncontinually being produced by spontaneous generation. Science has not as\r\nyet proved the truth of this belief, whatever the future may reveal.\r\nOn our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no\r\ndifficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does\r\nnot necessarily include progressive development--it only takes advantage\r\nof such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under\r\nits complex relations of life. And it may be asked what advantage,\r\nas far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule--to an\r\nintestinal worm--or even to an earth-worm, to be highly organised. If\r\nit were no advantage, these forms would be left, by natural selection,\r\nunimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite ages\r\nin their present lowly condition. And geology tells us that some of\r\nthe lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an\r\nenormous period in nearly their present state. But to suppose that most\r\nof the many now existing low forms have not in the least advanced since\r\nthe first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for every naturalist who\r\nhas dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the\r\nscale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautiful\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nNearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the different\r\ngrades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in the\r\nvertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish--among mammalia, to\r\nthe co-existence of man and the ornithorhynchus--among fishes, to the\r\nco-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter\r\nfish in the extreme simplicity of its structure approaches the\r\ninvertebrate classes. But mammals and fish hardly come into competition\r\nwith each other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of\r\ncertain members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to\r\ntheir taking the place of fishes. Physiologists believe that the brain\r\nmust be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires\r\naerial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the\r\nwater lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to the\r\nsurface to breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family would not\r\ntend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz\r\nMuller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore\r\nof South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three lowest orders of\r\nmammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in South\r\nAmerica in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably interfere\r\nlittle with each other. Although organisation, on the whole, may have\r\nadvanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the scale will\r\nalways present many degrees of perfection; for the high advancement of\r\ncertain whole classes, or of certain members of each class, does not at\r\nall necessarily lead to the extinction of those groups with which\r\nthey do not enter into close competition. In some cases, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have been preserved to\r\nthe present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar stations, where\r\nthey have been subjected to less severe competition, and where their\r\nscanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable variations\r\narising.\r\n\r\nFinally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist throughout\r\nthe world, from various causes. In some cases variations or individual\r\ndifferences of a favourable nature may never have arisen for natural\r\nselection to act on and accumulate. In no case, probably, has time\r\nsufficed for the utmost possible amount of development. In some few\r\ncases there has been what we must call retrogression or organisation.\r\nBut the main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions\r\nof life a high organisation would be of no service--possibly would be of\r\nactual disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable\r\nto be put out of order and injured.\r\n\r\nLooking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may\r\nbelieve, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked,\r\ncould the first step in the advancement or differentiation of parts\r\nhave arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon as\r\nsimple unicellular organisms came by growth or division to be compounded\r\nof several cells, or became attached to any supporting surface, his law\r\n\"that homologous units of any order become differentiated in proportion\r\nas their relations to incident forces become different\" would come into\r\naction. But as we have no facts to guide us, speculation on the subject\r\nis almost useless. It is, however, an error to suppose that there would\r\nbe no struggle for existence, and, consequently, no natural selection,\r\nuntil many forms had been produced: variations in a single species\r\ninhabiting an isolated station might be beneficial, and thus the whole\r\nmass of individuals might be modified, or two distinct forms might\r\narise. But, as I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no\r\none ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the\r\norigin of species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance\r\non the mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present\r\ntime, and still more so during past ages.\r\n\r\nCONVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nMr. H.C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of\r\ndivergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes), and\r\nthat convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part. If\r\ntwo species belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had both\r\nproduced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable\r\nthat these might approach each other so closely that they would have\r\nall to be classed under the same genus; and thus the descendants of two\r\ndistinct genera would converge into one. But it would in most cases\r\nbe extremely rash to attribute to convergence a close and general\r\nsimilarity of structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct\r\nforms. The shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular\r\nforces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should\r\nsometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should\r\nbear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex\r\nrelations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due\r\nto causes far too intricate to be followed out--on the nature of the\r\nvariations which have been preserved or selected, and this depends on\r\nthe surrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on\r\nthe surrounding organisms with which each being has come into\r\ncompetition--and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating\r\nelement) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms\r\ndetermined through equally complex relations. It is incredible that the\r\ndescendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in a marked\r\nmanner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near\r\napproach to identity throughout their whole organisation. If this had\r\noccurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of genetic\r\nconnection, recurring in widely separated geological formations; and the\r\nbalance of evidence is opposed to any such an admission.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural\r\nselection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make an\r\nindefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere inorganic conditions\r\nare concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of species\r\nwould soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of heat,\r\nmoisture, etc.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of organic\r\nbeings are more important; and as the number of species in any country\r\ngoes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become more and\r\nmore complex. Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount\r\nof profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to\r\nthe number of species which might be produced. We do not know that even\r\nthe most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms: at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an astonishing number\r\nof species, many European plants have become naturalised. But geology\r\nshows us, that from an early part of the tertiary period the number of\r\nspecies of shells, and that from the middle part of this same period,\r\nthe number of mammals has not greatly or at all increased. What then\r\nchecks an indefinite increase in the number of species? The amount of\r\nlife (I do not mean the number of specific forms) supported on an\r\narea must have a limit, depending so largely as it does on physical\r\nconditions; therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species,\r\neach or nearly each species will be represented by few individuals;\r\nand such species will be liable to extermination from accidental\r\nfluctuations in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their\r\nenemies. The process of extermination in such cases would be rapid,\r\nwhereas the production of new species must always be slow. Imagine the\r\nextreme case of as many species as individuals in England, and the\r\nfirst severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate thousands on\r\nthousands of species. Rare species, and each species will become rare\r\nif the number of species in any country becomes indefinitely increased,\r\nwill, on the principal often explained, present within a given period\r\nfew favourable variations; consequently, the process of giving birth to\r\nnew specific forms would thus be retarded. When any species becomes\r\nvery rare, close interbreeding will help to exterminate it; authors have\r\nthought that this comes into play in accounting for the deterioration\r\nof the aurochs in Lithuania, of red deer in Scotland and of bears\r\nin Norway, etc. Lastly, and this I am inclined to think is the most\r\nimportant element, a dominant species, which has already beaten many\r\ncompetitors in its own home, will tend to spread and supplant many\r\nothers. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those species which spread\r\nwidely tend generally to spread VERY widely, consequently they will tend\r\nto supplant and exterminate several species in several areas, and thus\r\ncheck the inordinate increase of specific forms throughout the world.\r\nDr. Hooker has recently shown that in the southeast corner of Australia,\r\nwhere, apparently, there are many invaders from different quarters of\r\nthe globe, the endemic Australian species have been greatly reduced in\r\nnumber. How much weight to attribute to these several considerations I\r\nwill not pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each country\r\nthe tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nIf under changing conditions of life organic beings present individual\r\ndifferences in almost every part of their structure, and this cannot be\r\ndisputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical rate of increase, a\r\nsevere struggle for life at some age, season or year, and this certainly\r\ncannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the\r\nrelations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions\r\nof life, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and\r\nhabits, to be advantageous to them, it would be a most extraordinary\r\nfact if no variations had ever occurred useful to each being's own\r\nwelfare, in the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful\r\nto man. But if variations useful to any organic being ever do occur,\r\nassuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of\r\nbeing preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle\r\nof inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring similarly\r\ncharacterised. This principle of preservation, or the survival of the\r\nfittest, I have called natural selection. It leads to the improvement\r\nof each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of\r\nlife; and consequently, in most cases, to what must be regarded as an\r\nadvance in organisation. Nevertheless, low and simple forms will long\r\nendure if well fitted for their simple conditions of life.\r\n\r\nNatural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at\r\ncorresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily as the\r\nadult. Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid to\r\nordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted\r\nmales the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give\r\ncharacters useful to the males alone in their struggles or rivalry with\r\nother males; and these characters will be transmitted to one sex or to\r\nboth sexes, according to the form of inheritance which prevails.\r\n\r\nWhether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the various\r\nforms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged\r\nby the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following\r\nchapters. But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how\r\nlargely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly\r\ndeclares. Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for\r\nthe more organic beings diverge in structure, habits and constitution,\r\nby so much the more can a large number be supported on the area, of\r\nwhich we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot, and\r\nto the productions naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during\r\nthe modification of the descendants of any one species, and during\r\nthe incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more\r\ndiversified the descendants become, the better will be their chance\r\nof success in the battle for life. Thus the small differences\r\ndistinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend to increase,\r\ntill they equal the greater differences between species of the same\r\ngenus, or even of distinct genera.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and widely\r\nranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each class, which\r\nvary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring\r\nthat superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.\r\nNatural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of\r\ncharacter and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate\r\nforms of life. On these principles, the nature of the affinities, and\r\nthe generally well defined distinctions between the innumerable organic\r\nbeings in each class throughout the world, may be explained. It is a\r\ntruly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from\r\nfamiliarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and\r\nspace should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to groups,\r\nin the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same\r\nspecies most closely related, species of the same genus less closely and\r\nunequally related, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct\r\ngenera much less closely related, and genera related in different\r\ndegrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and\r\nclasses. The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked\r\nin a single file, but seem clustered round points, and these round\r\nother points, and so on in almost endless cycles. If species had been\r\nindependently created, no explanation would have been possible of this\r\nkind of classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the\r\ncomplex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence\r\nof character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\r\nrepresented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the\r\ntruth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and\r\nthose produced during former years may represent the long succession\r\nof extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs\r\nhave tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the\r\nsurrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups\r\nof species have at all times overmastered other species in the great\r\nbattle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into\r\nlesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was\r\nyoung, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present\r\nbuds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all\r\nextinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many\r\ntwigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three,\r\nnow grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the other branches;\r\nso with the species which lived during long-past geological periods,\r\nvery few have left living and modified descendants. From the first\r\ngrowth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off;\r\nand these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole\r\norders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives,\r\nand which are known to us only in a fossil state. As we here and there\r\nsee a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree,\r\nand which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its\r\nsummit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or\r\nLepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two\r\nlarge branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal\r\ncompetition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise\r\nby growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop\r\non all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has\r\nbeen with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken\r\nbranches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its\r\never-branching and beautiful ramifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"IX","numeral":"IX","title":" HYBRIDISM.","text":"CHAPTER IX. HYBRIDISM.\r\n\r\n Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of\r\n hybrids--Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close\r\n interbreeding, removed by domestication--Laws governing the sterility\r\n of hybrids--Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on\r\n other differences, not accumulated by natural selection--Causes of\r\n the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids--Parallelism between the\r\n effects of changed conditions of life and of crossing--Dimorphism and\r\n trimorphism--Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel\r\n offspring not universal--Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of\r\n their fertility--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when\r\nintercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order\r\nto prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first highly\r\nprobable, for species living together could hardly have been kept\r\ndistinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is in\r\nmany ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species\r\nwhen first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have been\r\nacquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive profitable\r\ndegrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of differences in the\r\nreproductive systems of the parent-species.\r\n\r\nIn treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent\r\nfundamentally different, have generally been confounded; namely, the\r\nsterility of species when first crossed, and the sterility of the\r\nhybrids produced from them.\r\n\r\nPure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\r\ncondition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no\r\noffspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs\r\nfunctionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the\r\nmale element in both plants and animals; though the formative organs\r\nthemselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals.\r\nIn the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo\r\nare perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or\r\nare imperfectly developed. This distinction is important, when the\r\ncause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be\r\nconsidered. The distinction probably has been slurred over, owing to the\r\nsterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond\r\nthe province of our reasoning powers.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to be\r\ndescended from common parents, when crossed, and likewise the fertility\r\nof their mongrel offspring, is, with reference to my theory, of equal\r\nimportance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad\r\nand clear distinction between varieties and species.\r\n\r\nDEGREES OF STERILITY.\r\n\r\nFirst, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid\r\noffspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of\r\nthose two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner,\r\nwho almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply\r\nimpressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.\r\nKolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in\r\nten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as\r\ndistinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them\r\nas varieties. Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he\r\ndisputes the entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases. But in these and\r\nin many other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in\r\norder to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares\r\nthe maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed,\r\nand the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the average\r\nnumber produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. But\r\ncauses of serious error here intervene: a plant, to be hybridised, must\r\nbe castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded\r\nin order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other\r\nplants. Nearly all the plants experimented on by Gartner were potted,\r\nand were kept in a chamber in his house. That these processes are often\r\ninjurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gartner\r\ngives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated,\r\nand artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding\r\nall cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged\r\ndifficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their\r\nfertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gartner repeatedly\r\ncrossed some forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels\r\n(Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as\r\nvarieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many\r\nspecies are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he believed.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species\r\nwhen crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly,\r\nand, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily\r\naffected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is\r\nmost difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.\r\nI think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two\r\nmost experienced observers who have ever lived, namely Kolreuter and\r\nGartner, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some\r\nof the very same forms. It is also most instructive to compare--but I\r\nhave not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our\r\nbest botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be\r\nranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced\r\nby different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made\r\nduring different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor\r\nfertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties.\r\nThe evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the\r\nsame degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and\r\nstructural differences.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though\r\nGartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a\r\ncross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for\r\nten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\r\nincreases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly. With respect\r\nto this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in\r\nstructure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often\r\ntransmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual\r\nelements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree. But I\r\nbelieve that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these\r\ncases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I\r\nhave made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on\r\nthe one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or\r\nvariety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on\r\nthe other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and\r\nfertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion.\r\nHybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as\r\nthe parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same\r\ngarden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the\r\nflowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally\r\nbe fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower; and\r\nthis would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened\r\nby their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a\r\nremarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even\r\nthe less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen\r\nof the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill\r\neffects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on\r\nincreasing. Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is\r\nas often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the\r\nanthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself\r\nwhich is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though\r\nprobably often on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover,\r\nwhenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer\r\nas Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured\r\nin each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either\r\nfrom the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature.\r\nAnd thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive\r\ngenerations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those\r\nspontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by\r\ntoo close interbreeding having been avoided.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most experienced\r\nhybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is as emphatic in\r\nhis conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as\r\nthe pure parent-species--as are Kolreuter and Gartner that some degree\r\nof sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature.\r\nHe experimented on some of the very same species as did Gartner. The\r\ndifference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by\r\nHerbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hot-houses at his\r\ncommand. Of his many important statements I will here give only a single\r\none as an example, namely, that \"every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense\r\nfertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur\r\nin a case of its natural fecundation.\" So that here we have perfect, or\r\neven more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross between two\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nThis case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact, namely,\r\nthat individual plants of certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum and\r\nPassiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen from a distinct\r\nspecies, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this pollen can\r\nbe proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants or species.\r\nIn the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by Professor Hildebrand,\r\nin various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Muller, all the\r\nindividuals are in this peculiar condition. So that with some species,\r\ncertain abnormal individuals, and in other species all the individuals,\r\ncan actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be fertilised\r\nby pollen from the same individual plant! To give one instance, a bulb\r\nof Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised\r\nby Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently\r\nfertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three\r\ndistinct species: the result was that \"the ovaries of the three first\r\nflowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely,\r\nwhereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous\r\ngrowth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which\r\nvegetated freely.\" Mr. Herbert tried similar experiments during many\r\nyears, and always with the same result. These cases serve to show on\r\nwhat slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a\r\nspecies sometimes depends.\r\n\r\nThe practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with\r\nscientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how\r\ncomplicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,\r\nPetunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these\r\nhybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from\r\nCalceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar\r\nin general habit, \"reproduces itself as perfectly as if it had been a\r\nnatural species from the mountains of Chile.\" I have taken some pains\r\nto ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of\r\nRhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile.\r\nMr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for\r\ngrafting from a hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and catawbiense, and that\r\nthis hybrid \"seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine.\" Had hybrids,\r\nwhen fairly treated, always gone on decreasing in fertility in each\r\nsuccessive generation, as Gartner believed to be the case, the fact\r\nwould have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large\r\nbeds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated, for by\r\ninsect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross freely with\r\neach other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus\r\nprevented. Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of\r\ninsect agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of\r\nhybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their\r\nstigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.\r\n\r\nIn regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried\r\nthan with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that\r\nis, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the\r\ngenera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely distinct\r\nin the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the case\r\nof plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. It\r\nshould, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding\r\nfreely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for\r\ninstance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of\r\nfinches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have\r\nno right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary,\r\nor that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect\r\nto the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid\r\nanimals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same\r\nhybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so\r\nas to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary,\r\nbrothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive\r\ngeneration, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every\r\nbreeder. And in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent\r\nsterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing.\r\n\r\nAlthough I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of\r\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the\r\nhybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus\r\ncolchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile. M. Quatrefages\r\nstates that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia)\r\nwere proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight generations. It\r\nhas lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare and\r\nrabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce offspring, which\r\nare highly fertile when crossed with one of the parent-species. The\r\nhybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which\r\nare so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have\r\noften bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single\r\ninstance they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who\r\nraised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches;\r\nand from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids\r\n(grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however,\r\nthese cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by\r\ntwo eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that\r\nwhole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of\r\nthe country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure\r\nparent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nWith our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed together\r\nare quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or more\r\nwild species. From this fact we must conclude either that the aboriginal\r\nparent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the\r\nhybrids subsequently reared under domestication became quite fertile.\r\nThis latter alternative, which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by\r\nfar the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted. It is, for\r\ninstance, almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild\r\nstocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic\r\ndogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; but analogy makes\r\nme greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first\r\nhave freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids.\r\nSo again I have lately acquired decisive evidence that the crossed\r\noffspring from the Indian humped and common cattle are inter se\r\nperfectly fertile; and from the observations by Rutimeyer on their\r\nimportant osteological differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth\r\non their differences in habits, voice, constitution, etc., these two\r\nforms must be regarded as good and distinct species. The same remarks\r\nmay be extended to the two chief races of the pig. We must, therefore,\r\neither give up the belief of the universal sterility of species when\r\ncrossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals, not as an\r\nindelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nFinally, considering all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\r\nplants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,\r\nboth in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;\r\nbut that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered\r\nas absolutely universal.\r\n\r\nLAWS GOVERNING THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing the\r\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be to\r\nsee whether or not these laws indicate that species have been specially\r\nendowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and\r\nblending together in utter confusion. The following conclusions are\r\ndrawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on the hybridisation\r\nof plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far they apply\r\nto animals, and, considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to\r\nhybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same\r\nrules apply to both kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of\r\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility.\r\nIt is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown;\r\nbut only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen\r\nfrom a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a\r\ndistinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic\r\ndust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different\r\nspecies applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus,\r\nyields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly\r\ncomplete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in\r\ncertain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that\r\nwhich the plant's own pollen produces. So in hybrids themselves, there\r\nare some which never have produced, and probably never would produce,\r\neven with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in\r\nsome of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by\r\nthe pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the\r\nhybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the\r\nearly withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient\r\nfertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have\r\nself-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds\r\nup to perfect fertility.\r\n\r\nThe hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross,\r\nand which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but\r\nthe parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the\r\nsterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are\r\ngenerally confounded together--is by no means strict. There are many\r\ncases, in which two pure species, as in the genus Verbascum, can be\r\nunited with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid offspring,\r\nyet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the other hand, there are\r\nspecies which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty,\r\nbut the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. Even within\r\nthe limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two\r\nopposite cases occur.\r\n\r\nThe fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily\r\naffected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure species. But\r\nthe fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it\r\nis not always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed\r\nunder the same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution\r\nof the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.\r\nSo it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to\r\ndiffer greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the\r\nsame capsule and exposed to the same conditions.\r\n\r\nBy the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance\r\nbetween species in structure and constitution. Now the fertility\r\nof first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely\r\ngoverned by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids\r\nnever having been raised between species ranked by systematists in\r\ndistinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied\r\nspecies generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between\r\nsystematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.\r\nA multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which\r\nwill not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand\r\nof very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In\r\nthe same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many\r\nspecies can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene,\r\nin which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between\r\nextremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the\r\nsame genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many\r\nspecies of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\r\nalmost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata, which is\r\nnot a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or\r\nto be fertilised, by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Many\r\nanalogous facts could be given.\r\n\r\nNo one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of\r\ndifference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent two\r\nspecies crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in\r\nhabit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in\r\nevery part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the\r\ncotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and\r\nevergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\r\nextremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.\r\n\r\nBy a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for\r\ninstance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then\r\na mare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to have been\r\nreciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference\r\nin the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly\r\nimportant, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross\r\nis often completely independent of their systematic affinity, that is\r\nof any difference in their structure or constitution, excepting in their\r\nreproductive systems. The diversity of the result in reciprocal crosses\r\nbetween the same two species was long ago observed by Kolreuter. To give\r\nan instance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of\r\nM. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;\r\nbut Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following\r\nyears, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M.\r\njalapa, and utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could\r\nbe given. Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds\r\nor Fuci. Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in\r\nmaking reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has\r\nobserved it even between closely related forms (as Matthiola annua\r\nand glabra) which many botanists rank only as varieties. It is also a\r\nremarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of\r\ncourse compounded of the very same two species, the one species having\r\nfirst been used as the father and then as the mother, though they rarely\r\ndiffer in external characters, yet generally differ in fertility in a\r\nsmall, and occasionally in a high degree.\r\n\r\nSeveral other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for instance,\r\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;\r\nother species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing\r\ntheir likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at\r\nall necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which, instead\r\nof having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two\r\nparents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though\r\nexternally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare\r\nexceptions extremely sterile. So again among hybrids which are usually\r\nintermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and\r\nabnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of\r\ntheir pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile,\r\neven when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have\r\na considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how completely the\r\nfertility of a hybrid may be independent of its external resemblance to\r\neither pure parent.\r\n\r\nConsidering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility\r\nof first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be\r\nconsidered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility\r\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under\r\ncertain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being\r\neminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is\r\ninnately variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in\r\nthe first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the\r\nfertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble\r\nin external appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of\r\nmaking a first cross between any two species is not always governed by\r\ntheir systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This\r\nlatter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result of\r\nreciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according as the\r\none species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there\r\nis generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible\r\ndifference, in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids,\r\nmoreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.\r\n\r\nNow do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\r\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded\r\nin nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely\r\ndifferent in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which\r\nwe must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending\r\ntogether? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in\r\nthe individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with\r\nfacility and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross\r\nwith extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids?\r\nWhy should there often be so great a difference in the result of a\r\nreciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be\r\nasked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To grant to species\r\nthe special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further\r\npropagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to\r\nthe facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly\r\nto indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids,\r\nis simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their\r\nreproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited\r\na nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species,\r\nthe male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female\r\nsexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will be\r\nadvisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean\r\nby sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially\r\nendowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on\r\nanother is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I presume\r\nthat no one will suppose that this capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed\r\nquality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws\r\nof growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one\r\ntree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth,\r\nin the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of\r\ntheir sap, etc.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason\r\nwhatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and\r\nthe other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and\r\nadaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two\r\ngrafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity\r\nis limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft\r\ntogether trees belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other\r\nhand, closely allied species and varieties of the same species, can\r\nusually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But this capacity,\r\nas in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic\r\naffinity. Although many distinct genera within the same family have been\r\ngrafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take\r\non each other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince,\r\nwhich is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a\r\nmember of the same genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with\r\ndifferent degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties\r\nof the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.\r\n\r\nAs Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in\r\ndifferent INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret\r\nbelieves this to be the case with different individuals of the same\r\ntwo species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the\r\nfacility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it\r\nsometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot\r\nbe grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with\r\ndifficulty, on the gooseberry.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive\r\norgans in an imperfect condition, is a different case from the\r\ndifficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive\r\norgans perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases run to a large\r\nextent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin\r\nfound that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own\r\nroots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on a fourth\r\nspecies, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other hand,\r\ncertain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice\r\nas much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this latter\r\nfact of the extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, etc., which\r\nseed much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct\r\nspecies than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, although there is a clear and great difference between\r\nthe mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female\r\nelements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree of\r\nparallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species.\r\nAnd as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the\r\nfacility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on\r\nunknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the\r\nstill more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are\r\nincidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. These\r\ndifferences in both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might\r\nhave been expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of\r\nresemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be\r\nexpressed. The facts by no means seem to indicate that the greater or\r\nlesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various species\r\nhas been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the\r\ndifficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific\r\nforms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.\r\n\r\nAt one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that\r\nthe sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly\r\nacquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of\r\nfertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in\r\ncertain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another\r\nvariety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or\r\nincipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same\r\nprinciple that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it\r\nis necessary that he should keep them separate. In the first place,\r\nit may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often\r\nsterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage\r\nto such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile,\r\nand consequently this could not have been effected through natural\r\nselection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered\r\nsterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would\r\nfollow as a necessary contingency. In the second place, it is almost as\r\nmuch opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special\r\ncreation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should\r\nhave been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same\r\ntime the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise\r\nthe first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could\r\nhardly have been advantageous to either species.\r\n\r\nIn considering the probability of natural selection having come into\r\naction, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty\r\nwill be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from\r\nslightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted\r\nthat it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some\r\nslight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some\r\nother variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring\r\nwould be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in\r\nprocess of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the\r\nsteps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through\r\nnatural selection to that high degree which is common with so\r\nmany species, and which is universal with species which have been\r\ndifferentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject\r\nextraordinarily complex. After mature reflection, it seems to me that\r\nthis could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the\r\ncase of any two species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile\r\noffspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those\r\nindividuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree\r\nwith mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step\r\ntowards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory\r\nof natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred\r\nwith many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With\r\nsterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in\r\ntheir structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural\r\nselection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the\r\ncommunity to which they belonged over other communities of the same\r\nspecies; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community,\r\nif rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would\r\nnot thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage\r\nto the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nBut it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail: for with\r\nplants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed species\r\nmust be due to some principle, quite independent of natural selection.\r\nBoth Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in genera including numerous\r\nspecies, a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield\r\nfewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but\r\nyet are affected by the pollen of certain other species, for the germen\r\nswells. It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile\r\nindividuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme\r\nof sterility, when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained\r\nthrough selection; and from the laws governing the various grades of\r\nsterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\r\nwe may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly\r\nthe same in all cases.\r\n\r\nWe will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the\r\ndifferences between species which induce sterility in first crosses and\r\nin hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less difficulty\r\nin effecting a union and in obtaining offspring apparently depends\r\non several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical\r\nimpossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the\r\ncase with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to\r\nreach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when the pollen of one\r\nspecies is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though\r\nthe pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface.\r\nAgain, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable\r\nof causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case\r\nwith some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given\r\nof these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on\r\nothers. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early\r\nperiod. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to;\r\nbut I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who\r\nhas had great experience in hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the\r\nearly death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first\r\ncrosses. Mr. Salter has recently given the results of an examination of\r\nabout 500 eggs produced from various crosses between three species\r\nof Gallus and their hybrids; the majority of these eggs had been\r\nfertilised; and in the majority of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had\r\neither been partially developed and had then perished, or had become\r\nnearly mature, but the young chickens had been unable to break through\r\nthe shell. Of the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died\r\nwithin the first few days, or at latest weeks, \"without any obvious\r\ncause, apparently from mere inability to live;\" so that from the 500\r\neggs only twelve chickens were reared. With plants, hybridized embryos\r\nprobably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that\r\nhybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and\r\ndwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has\r\nrecently given some striking cases with hybrid willows. It may be here\r\nworth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within\r\nthe eggs of silk moths which had not been fertilised, pass through their\r\nearly stages of development and then perish like the embryos produced by\r\na cross between distinct species. Until becoming acquainted with these\r\nfacts, I was unwilling to believe in the frequent early death of\r\nhybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and\r\nlong-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however,\r\nare differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and\r\nliving in a country where their two parents live, they are generally\r\nplaced under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of only\r\nhalf of the nature and constitution of its mother; it may therefore,\r\nbefore birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb, or\r\nwithin the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions\r\nin some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an\r\nearly period; more especially as all very young beings are eminently\r\nsensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life. But after all,\r\nthe cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act\r\nof impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather\r\nthan in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are\r\nimperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different. I have more than\r\nonce alluded to a large body of facts showing that, when animals and\r\nplants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely\r\nliable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. This,\r\nin fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between the\r\nsterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points\r\nof similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general\r\nhealth, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance.\r\nIn both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male\r\nelement is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female\r\nmore than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with\r\nsystematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered\r\nimpotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species\r\ntend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a\r\ngroup will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired\r\nfertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile\r\nhybrids. No one can tell till he tries, whether any particular animal\r\nwill breed under confinement, or any exotic plant seed freely under\r\nculture; nor can he tell till he tries, whether any two species of a\r\ngenus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic\r\nbeings are placed during several generations under conditions not\r\nnatural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which seems to be\r\npartly due to their reproductive systems having been specially affected,\r\nthough in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. So it is with\r\nhybrids, for their offspring in successive generations are eminently\r\nliable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.\r\n\r\nThus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\r\nconditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of\r\ntwo species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state\r\nof health, is affected in a very similar manner. In the one case, the\r\nconditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a\r\ndegree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of\r\nhybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the\r\norganisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and\r\nconstitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having been\r\nblended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two organisations\r\nshould be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the\r\ndevelopment, or periodical action, or mutual relations of the different\r\nparts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life. When\r\nhybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring\r\nfrom generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and\r\nhence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some\r\ndegree variable, does not diminish; it is even apt to increase,\r\nthis being generally the result, as before explained, of too close\r\ninterbreeding. The above view of the sterility of hybrids being caused\r\nby two constitutions being compounded into one has been strongly\r\nmaintained by Max Wichura.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above or\r\nany other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;\r\nfor instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal\r\ncrosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally\r\nand exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend\r\nthat the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation\r\nis offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions,\r\nis rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show is, that in two\r\ncases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result--in the\r\none case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other\r\ncase from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations\r\nbeing compounded into one.\r\n\r\nA similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different\r\nclass of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief, founded on a\r\nconsiderable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that slight\r\nchanges in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things.\r\nWe see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent\r\nexchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to another,\r\nand back again. During the convalescence of animals, great benefit is\r\nderived from almost any change in their habits of life. Again, both with\r\nplants and animals, there is the clearest evidence that a cross between\r\nindividuals of the same species, which differ to a certain extent, gives\r\nvigour and fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding\r\ncontinued during several generations between the nearest relations, if\r\nthese be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to\r\ndecreased size, weakness, or sterility.\r\n\r\nHence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions\r\nof life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight\r\ncrosses, that is, crosses between the males and females of the same\r\nspecies, which have been subjected to slightly different conditions, or\r\nwhich have slightly varied, give vigour and fertility to the offspring.\r\nBut, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain\r\nuniform conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under\r\nconfinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very\r\nfrequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross\r\nbetween two forms that have become widely or specifically different,\r\nproduce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile. I am\r\nfully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident\r\nor an illusion. He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a\r\nmultitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under\r\nonly partial confinement in their native country, will be able to\r\nexplain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He will\r\nat the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of some of\r\nour domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to new and\r\nnot uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although they are\r\ndescended from distinct species, which would probably have been sterile\r\nif aboriginally crossed. The above two parallel series of facts seem\r\nto be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is\r\nessentially related to the principle of life; this principle, according\r\nto Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the\r\nincessant action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout\r\nnature, are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this\r\ntendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nRECIPROCAL DIMORPHISM AND TRIMORPHISM.\r\n\r\nThis subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to throw\r\nsome light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct orders\r\npresent two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ\r\nin no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form having\r\na long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long\r\nstamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains. With trimorphic\r\nplants there are three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their\r\npistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and\r\nin some other respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two\r\nsets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens\r\nand three kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length\r\nto each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level\r\nwith the stigma of the third form. Now I have shown, and the result\r\nhas been confirmed by other observers, that in order to obtain full\r\nfertility with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the\r\none form should be fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of\r\ncorresponding height in another form. So that with dimorphic species\r\ntwo unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully fertile; and\r\ntwo, which may be called illegitimate, are more or less infertile. With\r\ntrimorphic species six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and\r\ntwelve are illegitimate, or more or less infertile.\r\n\r\nThe infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by\r\npollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,\r\ndiffers much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the\r\nsame manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree\r\nof sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the\r\nconditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it\r\nwith illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct\r\nspecies be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be\r\nafterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the\r\nsame stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally\r\nannihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen\r\nof the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is\r\nstrongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the\r\nsame stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first\r\nillegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with\r\npollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings\r\nwere similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen,\r\nthough applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed\r\nor prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen.\r\nAgain, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species,\r\nthere is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same\r\nthing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form\r\nof Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest\r\nease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and\r\nyielded many seeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed when\r\nfertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.\r\n\r\nIn all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms\r\nof the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in\r\nexactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed. This\r\nled me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised\r\nfrom several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these\r\nillegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile. It\r\nis possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and\r\nshort-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three\r\nillegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in a legitimate\r\nmanner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they\r\nshould not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately\r\nfertilised. But such is not the case. They are all infertile, in various\r\ndegrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did\r\nnot yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule. The\r\nsterility of these illegitimate plants, when united with each other in\r\na legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids when\r\ncrossed inter se. If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either\r\npure parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it\r\nis when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant. In\r\nthe same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run\r\nparallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two\r\nparent-species, so that sterility of certain illegitimate plants was\r\nunusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they\r\nwere derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from the same\r\nseed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so it is in a\r\nmarked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse\r\nand persistent flowerers, while other and more sterile hybrids produce\r\nfew flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur\r\nwith the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nAltogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour\r\nbetween illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an exaggeration\r\nto maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids, produced within the\r\nlimits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms, while\r\nordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called\r\ndistinct species. We have also already seen that there is the closest\r\nsimilarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first\r\ncrosses between distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully\r\napparent by an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two\r\nwell-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the\r\ntrimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing\r\nwhether they were specifically distinct. He would find that they yielded\r\nonly about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and that they behaved\r\nin all the other above specified respects as if they had been two\r\ndistinct species. But to make the case sure, he would raise plants from\r\nhis supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the seedlings were\r\nmiserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all\r\nother respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then maintain that he\r\nhad actually proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two\r\nvarieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but\r\nhe would be completely mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,\r\nbecause they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened\r\nfertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion\r\nof specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there is\r\nsome unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions\r\nwith that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the\r\nsame view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and\r\nthis seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the\r\nsame species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in\r\nstructure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and yet\r\nbe sterile when united in certain ways. For we must remember that it is\r\nthe union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for\r\ninstance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility; while it\r\nis the union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which\r\nis fertile. Hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse\r\nof what occurs, in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the same\r\nspecies and with crosses between distinct species. It is, however,\r\ndoubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this\r\nobscure subject.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic\r\nand trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when\r\ncrossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature\r\nof their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure\r\nor general constitution. We are also led to this same conclusion by\r\nconsidering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot\r\nbe united, or can be united with great difficulty, with the female of\r\na second species, while the converse cross can be effected with perfect\r\nfacility. That excellent observer, Gartner, likewise concluded that\r\nspecies when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their\r\nreproductive systems.\r\n\r\nFERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED, AND OF THEIR MONGREL OFFSPRING, NOT\r\nUNIVERSAL.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be some\r\nessential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch as the\r\nlatter, however much they may differ from each other in external\r\nappearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile\r\noffspring. With some exceptions, presently to be given, I fully admit\r\nthat this is the rule. But the subject is surrounded by difficulties,\r\nfor, looking to varieties produced under nature, if two forms hitherto\r\nreputed to be varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they\r\nare at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the\r\nblue and red pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as\r\nvarieties, are said by Gartner to be quite sterile when crossed, and\r\nhe consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in\r\na circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will\r\nassuredly have to be granted.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,\r\nunder domestication, we are still involved in some doubt. For when it\r\nis stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous domestic\r\ndogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation which will\r\noccur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they are descended\r\nfrom aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility\r\nof so many domestic races, differing widely from each other in\r\nappearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a\r\nremarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there\r\nare, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly\r\nsterile when intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the\r\nfertility of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the first place,\r\nit may be observed that the amount of external difference between two\r\nspecies is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that\r\nsimilar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide. It\r\nis certain that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences\r\nin their sexual constitution. Now the varying conditions to which\r\ndomesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have had\r\nso little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner\r\nleading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for admitting\r\nthe directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions\r\ngenerally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated descendants\r\nof species, which in their natural state probably would have been in\r\nsome degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together.\r\nWith plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards\r\nsterility between distinct species, that in several well-authenticated\r\ncases already alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an\r\nopposite manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still\r\nretaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other\r\nspecies. If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility\r\nthrough long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly\r\nbe rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar\r\nconditions long-continued should likewise induce this tendency; though\r\nin certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility\r\nmight occasionally be thus caused. Thus, as I believe, we can understand\r\nwhy, with domesticated animals, varieties have not been produced\r\nwhich are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases,\r\nimmediately to be given, have been observed.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me,\r\nwhy domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed,\r\nbut why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon\r\nas they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take\r\nrank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is\r\nthis surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the\r\nnormal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can\r\nsee that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous\r\ncompetitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more\r\nuniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make\r\na wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals\r\nand plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected\r\nto captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of\r\norganic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would\r\nprobably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an\r\nunnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which,\r\nas shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally\r\nhighly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can\r\nnow generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of\r\nconditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be\r\nlittle liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by\r\nthe act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nI have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were\r\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to resist the\r\nevidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few\r\nfollowing cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at least\r\nas good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of\r\nspecies. The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses, who in\r\nall other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of\r\nspecific distinction. Gartner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind\r\nof maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing\r\nnear each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated\r\nsexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen\r\nflowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only a single\r\nhead produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains.\r\nManipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants\r\nhave separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these\r\nvarieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice\r\nthat the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY fertile;\r\nso that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two varieties as\r\nspecifically distinct.\r\n\r\nGirou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like\r\nthe maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual\r\nfertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are\r\ngreater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but\r\nthe forms experimented on are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his\r\nclassification by the test of infertility, as varieties, and Naudin has\r\ncome to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first\r\nincredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments\r\nmade during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an\r\nobserver and so hostile a witness as Gartner: namely, that the yellow\r\nand white varieties when crossed produce less seed than the similarly\r\ncoloured varieties of the same species. Moreover, he asserts that, when\r\nyellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and\r\nwhite varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the\r\ncrosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than between those which\r\nare differently coloured. Mr. Scott also has experimented on the species\r\nand varieties of Verbascum; and although unable to confirm Gartner's\r\nresults on the crossing of the distinct species, he finds that the\r\ndissimilarly coloured varieties of the same species yield fewer seeds,\r\nin the proportion of eighty-six to 100, than the similarly coloured\r\nvarieties. Yet these varieties differ in no respect, except in the\r\ncolour of their flowers; and one variety can sometimes be raised from\r\nthe seed of another.\r\n\r\nKolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent\r\nobserver, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular variety\r\nof the common tobacco was more fertile than the other varieties, when\r\ncrossed with a widely distinct species. He experimented on five forms\r\nwhich are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by\r\nthe severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their\r\nmongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties,\r\nwhen used either as the father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana\r\nglutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were\r\nproduced from the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa.\r\nHence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some\r\nmanner and in some degree modified.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties when\r\ncrossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great difficulty of\r\nascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a\r\nsupposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost\r\nuniversally be ranked as a species; from man attending only to external\r\ncharacters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not having\r\nbeen exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of life; from\r\nthese several considerations we may conclude that fertility does not\r\nconstitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when\r\ncrossed. The general sterility of crossed species may safely be looked\r\nat, not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as incidental on\r\nchanges of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.\r\n\r\nHYBRIDS AND MONGRELS COMPARED, INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR FERTILITY.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species\r\nand of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects.\r\nGartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line between\r\nspecies and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems to me,\r\nquite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of\r\nspecies, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties. And, on the\r\nother hand, they agree most closely in many important respects.\r\n\r\nI shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most\r\nimportant distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are\r\nmore variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from\r\nspecies which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first\r\ngeneration; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.\r\nGartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species\r\nare more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows\r\nthat the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.\r\nWhen mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several\r\ngenerations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both\r\ncases is notorious; but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels\r\nlong retaining a uniform character could be given. The variability,\r\nhowever, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater\r\nthan in hybrids.\r\n\r\nThis greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem at\r\nall surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly\r\ndomestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural\r\nvarieties), and this implies that there has been recent variability;\r\nwhich would often continue and would augment that arising from the act\r\nof crossing. The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation,\r\nin contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact\r\nand deserves attention. For it bears on the view which I have taken of\r\none of the causes of ordinary variability; namely, that the reproductive\r\nsystem, from being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life,\r\nfails under these circumstances to perform its proper function of\r\nproducing offspring closely similar in all respects to the parent-form.\r\nNow, hybrids in the first generation are descended from species\r\n(excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive\r\nsystems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids\r\nthemselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their\r\ndescendants are highly variable.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner states\r\nthat mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent\r\nform; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree.\r\nMoreover, Gartner expressly states that the hybrids from long cultivated\r\nplants are more subject to reversion than hybrids from species in their\r\nnatural state; and this probably explains the singular difference in\r\nthe results arrived at by different observers. Thus Max Wichura doubts\r\nwhether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and he experimented\r\non uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand,\r\ninsists in the strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to\r\nreversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants.\r\nGartner further states that when any two species, although most closely\r\nallied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are\r\nwidely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties\r\nof one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not\r\ndiffer much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded\r\non a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of\r\nseveral experiments made by Kolreuter.\r\n\r\nSuch alone are the unimportant differences which Gartner is able to\r\npoint out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the\r\ndegrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their\r\nrespective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly\r\nrelated species, follow, according to Gartner the same laws. When two\r\nspecies are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing\r\nits likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be with varieties of\r\nplants; and with animals, one variety certainly often has this prepotent\r\npower over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal\r\ncross generally resemble each other closely, and so it is with mongrel\r\nplants from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be\r\nreduced to either pure parent form, by repeated crosses in successive\r\ngenerations with either parent.\r\n\r\nThese several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the\r\nsubject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of\r\nsecondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency\r\nin transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in\r\nthe other, both when one species is crossed with another and when one\r\nvariety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those\r\nauthors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over\r\nthe horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely the\r\nass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the\r\nmale than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an offspring of\r\nthe male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is\r\nthe offspring of the female-ass and stallion.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that\r\nit is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in\r\ncharacter, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does\r\nsometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than\r\nwith mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred\r\nanimals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly\r\nconfined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have\r\nsuddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or\r\nhorns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters\r\nwhich have been slowly acquired through selection. A tendency to sudden\r\nreversions to the perfect character of either parent would, also,\r\nbe much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from\r\nvarieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than\r\nwith hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally\r\nproduced. On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who,\r\nafter arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals,\r\ncomes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its\r\nparents are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from\r\neach other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety, or\r\nof different varieties, or of distinct species.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all\r\nother respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the\r\noffspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at\r\nspecies as having been specially created, and at varieties as having\r\nbeen produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing\r\nfact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no\r\nessential distinction between species and varieties.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nFirst crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as\r\nspecies, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,\r\nsterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that\r\nthe most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically opposite\r\nconclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is innately\r\nvariable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently\r\nsusceptible to action of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The\r\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is\r\ngoverned by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different,\r\nand sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same\r\ntwo species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in\r\nthe hybrids produced from this cross.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species or\r\nvariety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally\r\nof an unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing,\r\nthe greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is\r\nincidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There\r\nis no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with\r\nvarious degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and blending\r\nin nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with\r\nvarious and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted\r\ntogether in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.\r\n\r\nThe sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been\r\nacquired through natural selection. In the case of first crosses it\r\nseems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances in chief\r\npart on the early death of the embryo. In the case of hybrids, it\r\napparently depends on their whole organisation having been disturbed by\r\nbeing compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility being closely\r\nallied to that which so frequently affects pure species, when exposed to\r\nnew and unnatural conditions of life. He who will explain these latter\r\ncases will be able to explain the sterility of hybrids. This view is\r\nstrongly supported by a parallelism of another kind: namely, that,\r\nfirstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour\r\nand fertility of all organic beings; and secondly, that the crossing of\r\nforms, which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life,\r\nor which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of their\r\noffspring. The facts given on the sterility of the illegitimate unions\r\nof dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their illegitimate progeny,\r\nperhaps render it probable that some unknown bond in all cases connects\r\nthe degree of fertility of first unions with that of their offspring.\r\nThe consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the\r\nresults of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that\r\nthe primary cause of the sterility of crossed species is confined to\r\ndifferences in their sexual elements. But why, in the case of distinct\r\nspecies, the sexual elements should so generally have become more or\r\nless modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but\r\nit seems to stand in some close relation to species having been exposed\r\nfor long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species,\r\nand the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases\r\ncorrespond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on the\r\namount of difference between the species which are crossed. Nor is\r\nit surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the\r\nfertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being\r\ngrafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on\r\nwidely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent,\r\nparallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to\r\nexperiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.\r\n\r\nFirst crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike\r\nto be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very\r\ngenerally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably fertile. Nor\r\nis this almost universal and perfect fertility surprising, when it\r\nis remembered how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to\r\nvarieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater\r\nnumber of varieties have been produced under domestication by the\r\nselection of mere external differences, and that they have not been long\r\nexposed to uniform conditions of life. It should also be especially kept\r\nin mind, that long-continued domestication tends to eliminate\r\nsterility, and is therefore little likely to induce this same quality.\r\nIndependently of the question of fertility, in all other respects there\r\nis the closest general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels, in\r\ntheir variability, in their power of absorbing each other by repeated\r\ncrosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both parent-forms.\r\nFinally, then, although we are as ignorant of the precise cause of the\r\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids as we are why animals and\r\nplants removed from their natural conditions become sterile, yet the\r\nfacts given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to the belief that\r\nspecies aboriginally existed as varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

LAWS OF VARIATION.\r\n\r\n Effects of changed conditions--Use and disuse, combined with natural\r\n selection; organs of flight and of vision--Acclimatisation--Correlated\r\n variation--Compensation and economy of growth--False\r\n correlations--Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures\r\n variable--Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable:\r\n specific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual\r\n characters variable--Species of the same genus vary in an analogous\r\n manner--Reversions to long-lost characters--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and\r\nmultiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser\r\ndegree with those under nature--were due to chance. This, of course is\r\na wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly\r\nour ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors\r\nbelieve it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to\r\nproduce individual differences, or slight deviations of structure, as\r\nto make the child like its parents. But the fact of variations and\r\nmonstrosities occurring much more frequently under domestication than\r\nunder nature, and the greater variability of species having wide ranges\r\nthan of those with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that\r\nvariability is generally related to the conditions of life to which each\r\nspecies has been exposed during several successive generations. In the\r\nfirst chapter I attempted to show that changed conditions act in two\r\nways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and\r\nindirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases there are two\r\nfactors, the nature of the organism, which is much the most important of\r\nthe two, and the nature of the conditions. The direct action of changed\r\nconditions leads to definite or indefinite results. In the latter case\r\nthe organisation seems to become plastic, and we have much fluctuating\r\nvariability. In the former case the nature of the organism is such that\r\nit yields readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all, or\r\nnearly all, the individuals become modified in the same way.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as of\r\nclimate, food, etc., have acted in a definite manner. There is reason\r\nto believe that in the course of time the effects have been greater than\r\ncan be proved by clear evidence. But we may safely conclude that the\r\ninnumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see throughout\r\nnature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed simply to\r\nsuch action. In the following cases the conditions seem to have produced\r\nsome slight definite effect: E. Forbes asserts that shells at their\r\nsouthern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly\r\ncoloured than those of the same species from further north or from a\r\ngreater depth; but this certainly does not always hold good. Mr. Gould\r\nbelieves that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under\r\na clear atmosphere, than when living near the coast or on islands; and\r\nWollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects the colours\r\nof insects. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which, when growing\r\nnear the sea-shore, have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not\r\nelsewhere fleshy. These slightly varying organisms are interesting in\r\nas far as they present characters analogous to those possessed by the\r\nspecies which are confined to similar conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot tell\r\nhow much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,\r\nand how much to the definite action of the conditions of life. Thus, it\r\nis well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker\r\nand better fur the further north they live; but who can tell how much of\r\nthis difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been\r\nfavoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the\r\naction of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has some\r\ndirect action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nInstances could be given of similar varieties being produced from the\r\nsame species under external conditions of life as different as can well\r\nbe conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties being\r\nproduced under apparently the same external conditions. Again,\r\ninnumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping\r\ntrue, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite\r\nclimates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on\r\nthe direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to\r\nvary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause\r\nvariability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include\r\nnatural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that\r\nvariety shall survive. But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly\r\nsee that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in\r\nsome manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the\r\nvariations in certain direction; and it is this latter agency which\r\nanswers to the survival of the fittest under nature.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS, AS CONTROLLED BY\r\nNATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be\r\nno doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged\r\ncertain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications\r\nare inherited. Under free nature we have no standard of comparison by\r\nwhich to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we\r\nknow not the parent-forms; but many animals possess structures which\r\ncan be best explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has\r\nremarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot\r\nfly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of\r\nSouth America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its\r\nwings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is\r\na remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham, can\r\nfly, while the adults have lost this power. As the larger ground-feeding\r\nbirds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it is probable that\r\nthe nearly wingless condition of several birds, now inhabiting or which\r\nlately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beasts of prey,\r\nhas been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and\r\nis exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but it\r\ncan defend itself, by kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many\r\nquadrupeds. We may believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had\r\nhabits like those of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of\r\nits body were increased during successive generations, its legs were\r\nused more and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.\r\n\r\nKirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior\r\ntarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often broken off;\r\nhe examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had\r\neven a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually\r\nlost that the insect has been described as not having them. In some\r\nother genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the\r\nAteuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient.\r\nThe evidence that accidental mutilations can be inherited is at present\r\nnot decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by Brown-Sequard in\r\nguinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations, should make us\r\ncautious in denying this tendency. Hence, it will perhaps be safest to\r\nlook at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their\r\nrudimentary condition in some other genera, not as cases of inherited\r\nmutilations, but as due to the effects of long-continued disuse; for\r\nas many dung-feeding beetles are generally found with their tarsi lost,\r\nthis must happen early in life; therefore the tarsi cannot be of much\r\nimportance or be much used by these insects.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of\r\nstructure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection. Mr.\r\nWollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of\r\nthe 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far\r\ndeficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the twenty-nine\r\nendemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their species in\r\nthis condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the\r\nworld are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in\r\nMadeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the\r\nwind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles\r\nis larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially\r\nthe extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that\r\ncertain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which\r\nabsolutely require the use of their wings, are here almost entirely\r\nabsent. These several considerations make me believe that the wingless\r\ncondition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of\r\nnatural selection, combined probably with disuse. For during many\r\nsuccessive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either\r\nfrom its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or\r\nfrom indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not\r\nbeing blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most\r\nreadily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea, and thus\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as\r\ncertain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use\r\ntheir wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects,\r\ntheir wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite\r\ncompatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect\r\nfirst arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to\r\nenlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number\r\nof individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or\r\nby giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners\r\nshipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good\r\nswimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would\r\nhave been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim\r\nat all and had stuck to the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,\r\nand in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This state of the\r\neyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided\r\nperhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the\r\ntuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the\r\nmole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that\r\nthey were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in\r\nthis condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been\r\ninflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of\r\nthe eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not\r\nnecessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their\r\nsize, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,\r\nmight in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would\r\naid the effects of disuse.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different\r\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and Kentucky, are blind. In\r\nsome of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is\r\ngone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with\r\nits glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes,\r\nthough useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in\r\ndarkness, their loss may be attributed to disuse. In one of the blind\r\nanimals, namely, the cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were captured by\r\nProfessor Silliman at above half a mile distance from the mouth of\r\nthe cave, and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were\r\nlustrous and of large size; and these animals, as I am informed by\r\nProfessor Silliman, after having been exposed for about a month to a\r\ngraduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\r\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in accordance\r\nwith the old view of the blind animals having been separately created\r\nfor the American and European caverns, very close similarity in their\r\norganisation and affinities might have been expected. This is certainly\r\nnot the case if we look at the two whole faunas; with respect to the\r\ninsects alone, Schiodte has remarked: \"We are accordingly prevented\r\nfrom considering the entire phenomenon in any other light than something\r\npurely local, and the similarity which is exhibited in a few forms\r\nbetween the Mammoth Cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola,\r\notherwise than as a very plain expression of that analogy which subsists\r\ngenerally between the fauna of Europe and of North America.\" On my view\r\nwe must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary\r\npowers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the\r\nouter world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves,\r\nas did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence\r\nof this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks: \"We accordingly\r\nlook upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have\r\npenetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of the\r\nadjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into darkness,\r\nhave been accommodated to surrounding circumstances. Animals not\r\nfar remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to\r\ndarkness. Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last\r\nof all, those destined for total darkness, and whose formation is quite\r\npeculiar.\" These remarks of Schiodte's it should be understood, apply\r\nnot to the same, but to distinct species. By the time that an animal had\r\nreached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse\r\nwill on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and\r\nnatural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an\r\nincrease in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for\r\nblindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to\r\nsee in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants\r\nof that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the\r\nEuropean continent. And this is the case with some of the American\r\ncave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European\r\ncave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding\r\ncountry. It would be difficult to give any rational explanation of the\r\naffinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the\r\ntwo continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. That\r\nseveral of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should\r\nbe closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship\r\nof most of their other productions. As a blind species of Bathyscia is\r\nfound in abundance on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in\r\nthe cave species of this one genus has probably had no relation to its\r\ndark habitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of\r\nvision should readily become adapted to dark caverns. Another blind\r\ngenus (Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the\r\nspecies, as Mr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere\r\nexcept in caves; yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and\r\nAmerica are distinct; but it is possible that the progenitors of these\r\nseveral species, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have\r\nranged over both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in\r\ntheir present secluded abodes. Far from feeling surprise that some of\r\nthe cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in\r\nregard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the\r\nblind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only\r\nsurprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,\r\nowing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of\r\nthese dark abodes will have been exposed.\r\n\r\nACCLIMATISATION.\r\n\r\nHabit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the\r\ntime of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate,\r\netc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it\r\nis extremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to\r\ninhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of\r\nthe same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation\r\nmust be readily effected during a long course of descent. It is\r\nnotorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home:\r\nspecies from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a\r\ntropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot\r\nendure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the\r\nclimates under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this\r\nfrom our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant\r\nwill endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals\r\nbrought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy. We\r\nhave reason to believe that species in a state of nature are closely\r\nlimited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite\r\nas much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But\r\nwhether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have\r\nevidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent,\r\nnaturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become\r\nacclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed\r\ncollected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different\r\nheights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country\r\ndifferent constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs\r\nme that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations\r\nhave been made by Mr. H.C. Watson on European species of plants brought\r\nfrom the Azores to England; and I could give other cases. In regard to\r\nanimals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having\r\nlargely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to\r\ncolder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that\r\nthese animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in\r\nall ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that\r\nthey have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new homes,\r\nso as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.\r\n\r\nAs we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\r\nuncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily\r\nunder confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable\r\nof far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity\r\nin our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different\r\nclimates, but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under\r\nthem, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other\r\nanimals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely\r\ndifferent climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument\r\ntoo far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic\r\nanimals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical\r\nand arctic wolf may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat\r\nand mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been\r\ntransported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider\r\nrange than any other rodent; for they live under the cold climate of\r\nFaroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many an\r\nisland in the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any special climate may\r\nbe looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility\r\nof constitution, common to most animals. On this view, the capacity of\r\nenduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic\r\nanimals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros having\r\nformerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now\r\nall tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked\r\nat as anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of\r\nconstitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into action.\r\n\r\nHow much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is\r\ndue to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties\r\nhaving different innate constitutions, and how much to both means\r\ncombined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom has some\r\ninfluence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the incessant\r\nadvice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias\r\nof China, to be very cautious in transporting animals from one district\r\nto another. And as it is not likely that man should have succeeded in\r\nselecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially\r\nfitted for their own districts, the result must, I think, be due to\r\nhabit. On the other hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to\r\npreserve those individuals which were born with constitutions best\r\nadapted to any country which they inhabited. In treatises on many kinds\r\nof cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain\r\nclimates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on\r\nfruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties\r\nare habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern\r\nstates; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot\r\nowe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem\r\nartichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and of which,\r\nconsequently, new varieties have not been produced, has even been\r\nadvanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it\r\nis now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has\r\nbeen often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight;\r\nbut until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his\r\nkidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by\r\nfrost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care\r\nto prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these\r\nseedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to\r\nhave been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in the\r\nconstitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has\r\nbeen published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and\r\nof this fact I have myself observed striking instances.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have,\r\nin some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the\r\nconstitution and structure; but that the effects have often been largely\r\ncombined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of\r\ninnate variations.\r\n\r\nCORRELATED VARIATION.\r\n\r\nI mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied\r\ntogether, during its growth and development, that when slight variations\r\nin any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection,\r\nother parts become modified. This is a very important subject, most\r\nimperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different classes of facts\r\nmay be here easily confounded together. We shall presently see that\r\nsimple inheritance often gives the false appearance of correlation. One\r\nof the most obvious real cases is, that variations of structure arising\r\nin the young or larvae naturally tend to affect the structure of the\r\nmature animal. The several parts which are homologous, and which, at\r\nan early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are\r\nnecessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary\r\nin a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body\r\nvarying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the\r\njaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some\r\nanatomists to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not\r\ndoubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection:\r\nthus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and\r\nif this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have\r\nbeen rendered permanent by natural selection.\r\n\r\nHomologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;\r\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more common than\r\nthe union of homologous parts in normal structures, as in the union of\r\nthe petals into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining\r\nsoft parts; it is believed by some authors that with birds the diversity\r\nin the shape of the pelvis causes the remarkable diversity in the shape\r\nof the kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human\r\nmother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. In\r\nsnakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner\r\nof swallowing determine the position and form of several of the most\r\nimportant viscera.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently,\r\nand that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any\r\nreason. What can be more singular than the relation in cats between\r\ncomplete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the\r\ntortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their\r\nfeathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence\r\nof more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the\r\nfuture colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair\r\nand the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology\r\ncomes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I\r\nthink it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which\r\nare most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and\r\nEdentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), are likewise on the\r\nwhole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there are so many exceptions\r\nto this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value.\r\n\r\nI know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\r\ncorrelation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of\r\nnatural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and\r\ninner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. Everyone is\r\nfamiliar with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for\r\ninstance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the\r\npartial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs. But in some\r\nof these plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture. These\r\ndifferences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the\r\ninvolucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of\r\nthe seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositae countenances this idea;\r\nbut with the Umbelliferae it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me,\r\nthe species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their\r\ninner and outer flowers. It might have been thought that the development\r\nof the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs\r\ncauses their abortion; but this can hardly be the sole case, for in some\r\nCompositae the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ, without any\r\ndifference in the corolla. Possibly these several differences may be\r\nconnected with the different flow of nutriment towards the central and\r\nexternal flowers. We know, at least, that with irregular flowers those\r\nnearest to the axis are most subject to peloria, that is to become\r\nabnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an instance of this fact, and as\r\na striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the two upper\r\npetals in the central flower of the truss often lose their patches\r\nof darker colour; and when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite\r\naborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric or regular. When the\r\ncolour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is\r\nnot quite aborted but is much shortened.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that\r\nthe ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly\r\nadvantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is\r\nhighly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into\r\nplay. But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their\r\ndifferences in shape, which are not always correlated with any\r\ndifference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the\r\nUmbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the\r\nseeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and\r\ncoelospermous in the central flowers--that the elder De Candolle founded\r\nhis main divisions in the order on such characters. Hence modifications\r\nof structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due\r\nto the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we\r\ncan judge, of the slightest service to the species.\r\n\r\nWe may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which\r\nare common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply\r\ndue to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through\r\nnatural selection some one modification in structure, and, after\r\nthousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and\r\nthese two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of\r\ndescendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in\r\nsome necessary manner correlated. Some other correlations are apparently\r\ndue to the manner in which natural selection can alone act. For\r\ninstance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never\r\nfound in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by\r\nthe impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural\r\nselection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could\r\nthe seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind,\r\ngain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND ECONOMY OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nThe elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their\r\nlaw of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed\r\nit, \"in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on\r\nthe other side.\" I think this holds true to a certain extent with our\r\ndomestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in\r\nexcess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is\r\ndifficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same\r\nvarieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage\r\nand a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits\r\nbecome atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality.\r\nIn our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally\r\naccompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished\r\nwattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained\r\nthat the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more\r\nespecially botanists, believe in its truth. I will not, however, here\r\ngive any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between\r\nthe effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through\r\nnatural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by the\r\nsame process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal\r\nof nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and\r\nadjoining part.\r\n\r\nI suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been\r\nadvanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more\r\ngeneral principle, namely, that natural selection is continually\r\ntrying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed\r\nconditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its\r\ndiminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to\r\nhave its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure. I can\r\nthus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining\r\ncirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,\r\nthat when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus\r\nprotected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.\r\nThis is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner\r\nwith the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists\r\nof the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously\r\ndeveloped, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the\r\nparasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the\r\nhead is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the\r\nprehensile antennae. Now the saving of a large and complex structure,\r\nwhen rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each\r\nsuccessive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life\r\nto which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of\r\nsupporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.\r\n\r\nThus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to\r\nreduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through\r\nchanged habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other\r\npart to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And conversely,\r\nthat natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing\r\nan organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of\r\nsome adjoining part.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE, RUDIMENTARY, AND LOWLY-ORGANISED STRUCTURES ARE VARIABLE.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both\r\nwith varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated\r\nmany times in the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the\r\nstamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the\r\nnumber of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers,\r\nis constant. The same author as well as some botanists, have further\r\nremarked that multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure.\r\nAs \"vegetative repetition,\" to use Professor Owen's expression, is\r\na sign of low organisation; the foregoing statements accord with the\r\ncommon opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale\r\nof nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that\r\nlowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have been\r\nbut little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same\r\npart has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it\r\nshould remain variable, that is, why natural selection should not have\r\npreserved or rejected each little deviation of form so carefully as when\r\nthe part has to serve for some one special purpose. In the same way that\r\na knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape;\r\nwhilst a tool for some particular purpose must be of some particular\r\nshape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely\r\nthrough and for the advantage of each being.\r\n\r\nRudimentary parts, as is generally admitted, are apt to be highly\r\nvariable. We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will here only\r\nadd that their variability seems to result from their uselessness,\r\nand consequently from natural selection having had no power to check\r\ndeviations in their structure.\r\n\r\nA PART DEVELOPED IN ANY SPECIES IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OR MANNER,\r\nIN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME PART IN ALLIED SPECIES, TENDS TO BE HIGHLY\r\nVARIABLE.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above effect made\r\nby Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have come to a nearly\r\nsimilar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the\r\ntruth of the above proposition without giving the long array of facts\r\nwhich I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. I\r\ncan only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. I\r\nam aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due\r\nallowances for them. It should be understood that the rule by no means\r\napplies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually\r\ndeveloped in one species or in a few species in comparison with the same\r\npart in many closely allied species. Thus, the wing of the bat is a most\r\nabnormal structure in the class of mammals; but the rule would not apply\r\nhere, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would apply\r\nonly if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable manner in\r\ncomparison with the other species of the same genus. The rule applies\r\nvery strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed\r\nin any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual characters, used by\r\nHunter, relates to characters which are attached to one sex, but are\r\nnot directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies\r\nto males and females; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer\r\nremarkable secondary sexual characters. The rule being so plainly\r\napplicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the\r\ngreat variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any\r\nunusual manner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But\r\nthat our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly\r\nshown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended\r\nto Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this order, and I am\r\nfully convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a\r\nfuture work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases. I will here\r\ngive only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application.\r\nThe opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in\r\nevery sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ\r\nextremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species\r\nof one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of\r\ndiversification; the homologous valves in the different species being\r\nsometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the\r\nindividuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration\r\nto state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each\r\nother in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the\r\nspecies belonging to other distinct genera.\r\n\r\nAs with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the same\r\ncountry, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to them;\r\nand the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class. I cannot make\r\nout that it applies to plants, and this would have seriously shaken my\r\nbelief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it\r\nparticularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.\r\n\r\nWhen we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner\r\nin a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance\r\nto that species: nevertheless it is in this case eminently liable to\r\nvariation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been\r\nindependently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see\r\nno explanation. But on the view that groups of species are descended\r\nfrom some other species, and have been modified through natural\r\nselection, I think we can obtain some light. First let me make some\r\npreliminary remarks. If, in our domestic animals, any part or the\r\nwhole animal be neglected, and no selection be applied, that part (for\r\ninstance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to\r\nhave a uniform character: and the breed may be said to be degenerating.\r\nIn rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little\r\nspecialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic\r\ngroups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases natural\r\nselection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the\r\norganisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here more\r\nparticularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic animals,\r\nwhich at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued\r\nselection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the\r\nindividuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a prodigious\r\namount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers, in the beak and\r\nwattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of fantails, etc., these\r\nbeing the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even in the\r\nsame sub-breed, as in that of the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously\r\ndifficult to breed nearly perfect birds, many departing widely from the\r\nstandard. There may truly be said to be a constant struggle going on\r\nbetween, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect\r\nstate, as well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the\r\nother hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In\r\nthe long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so\r\ncompletely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon from\r\na good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly going\r\non, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may always be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an\r\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species\r\nof the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an\r\nextraordinary amount of modification since the period when the several\r\nspecies branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This\r\nperiod will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species rarely\r\nendure for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of\r\nmodification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of\r\nvariability, which has continually been accumulated by natural\r\nselection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of\r\nthe extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and\r\nlong-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a\r\ngeneral rule, still expect to find more variability in such parts than\r\nin other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer\r\nperiod nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case. That the\r\nstruggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to\r\nreversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of\r\ntime cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made\r\nconstant, I see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ, however\r\nabnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same\r\ncondition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of\r\nthe bat, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an immense\r\nperiod in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more\r\nvariable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which\r\nthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great\r\nthat we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,\r\nstill present in a high degree. For in this case the variability\r\nwill seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the\r\nindividuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the\r\ncontinued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less\r\nmodified condition.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTERS MORE VARIABLE THAN GENERIC CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our\r\npresent subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more\r\nvariable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant: if\r\nin a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had\r\nred, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be\r\nsurprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely;\r\nbut if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become\r\na generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual\r\ncircumstance. I have chosen this example because the explanation which\r\nmost naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that\r\nspecific characters are more variable than generic, because they are\r\ntaken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly\r\nused for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only\r\nindirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in\r\nthe chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce\r\nevidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters\r\nare more variable than generic; but with respect to important\r\ncharacters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that\r\nwhen an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part,\r\nwhich is generally very constant throughout a large group of species,\r\nDIFFERS considerably in closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE\r\nin the individuals of the same species. And this fact shows that a\r\ncharacter, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value\r\nand becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its\r\nphysiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind\r\napplies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire apparently\r\nentertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the\r\ndifferent species of the same group, the more subject it is to anomalies\r\nin the individuals.\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\r\nwhy should that part of the structure, which differs from the same\r\npart in other independently created species of the same genus, be\r\nmore variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several\r\nspecies? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the\r\nview that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might\r\nexpect often to find them still continuing to vary in those parts of\r\ntheir structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and\r\nwhich have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another manner:\r\nthe points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and\r\nin which they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters;\r\nand these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common\r\nprogenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will\r\nhave modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less widely\r\ndifferent habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called\r\ngeneric characters have been inherited from before the period when the\r\nseveral species first branched off from their common progenitor, and\r\nsubsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in\r\na slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present\r\nday. On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other\r\nspecies of the same genus are called specific characters; and as these\r\nspecific characters have varied and come to differ since the period when\r\nthe species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable\r\nthat they should still often be in some degree variable--at least more\r\nvariable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long\r\nperiod remained constant.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS VARIABLE.\r\n\r\nI think it will be admitted by naturalists, without my entering on\r\ndetails, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable. It will\r\nalso be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other\r\nmore widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts\r\nof their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference\r\nbetween the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual\r\ncharacters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between\r\nthe females. The cause of the original variability of these characters\r\nis not manifest; but we can see why they should not have been rendered\r\nas constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual\r\nselection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection,\r\nas it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the\r\nless favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability\r\nof secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual\r\nselection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus have\r\nsucceeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of\r\ndifference in these than in other respects.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between the two\r\nsexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts\r\nof the organisation in which the species of the same genus differ from\r\neach other. Of this fact I will give in illustration the first two\r\ninstances which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in\r\nthese cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be\r\naccidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character common\r\nto very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has\r\nremarked, the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in\r\nthe two sexes of the same species. Again in the fossorial hymenoptera,\r\nthe neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance,\r\nbecause common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration\r\ndiffers in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the\r\nsame species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute\r\ncrustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law. \"In Pontella,\r\nfor instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly by the anterior\r\nantennae and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific differences also\r\nare principally given by these organs.\" This relation has a clear\r\nmeaning on my view: I look at all the species of the same genus as\r\nhaving as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two\r\nsexes of any one species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure\r\nof the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable;\r\nvariations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage\r\nof by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several places\r\nin the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with other males\r\nfor the possession of the females.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific\r\ncharacters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of\r\ngeneric characters, or those which are possessed by all the species;\r\nthat the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in\r\na species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in\r\nits congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part, however\r\nextraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of\r\nspecies; that the great variability of secondary sexual characters and\r\ntheir great difference in closely allied species; that secondary sexual\r\nand ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the\r\nsame parts of the organisation, are all principles closely connected\r\ntogether. All being mainly due to the species of the same group being\r\nthe descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited\r\nmuch in common, to parts which have recently and largely varied being\r\nmore likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been\r\ninherited and have not varied, to natural selection having more or less\r\ncompletely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency\r\nto reversion and to further variability, to sexual selection being\r\nless rigid than ordinary selection, and to variations in the same parts\r\nhaving been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus having\r\nbeen adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nDISTINCT SPECIES PRESENT ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS, SO THAT A VARIETY OF\r\nONE SPECIES OFTEN ASSUMES A CHARACTER PROPER TO AN ALLIED SPECIES, OR\r\nREVERTS TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN EARLY PROGENITOR.\r\n\r\nThese propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our\r\ndomestic races. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in countries\r\nwidely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the\r\nhead, and with feathers on the feet, characters not possessed by the\r\naboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or\r\nmore distinct races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even\r\nsixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation\r\nrepresenting the normal structure of another race, the fantail. I\r\npresume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are\r\ndue to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common\r\nparent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by\r\nsimilar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of\r\nanalogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots,\r\nof the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several botanists rank\r\nas varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this\r\nbe not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two\r\nso-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely,\r\nthe common turnip. According to the ordinary view of each species having\r\nbeen independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity\r\nin the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa\r\nof community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like\r\nmanner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation. Many\r\nsimilar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the\r\ngreat gourd family, and by various authors in our cereals. Similar\r\ncases occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been\r\ndiscussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them under his\r\nlaw of equable variability.\r\n\r\nWith pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional\r\nappearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars\r\non the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer\r\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these\r\nmarks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no\r\none will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet\r\nanalogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may, I think,\r\nconfidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these\r\ncoloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring\r\nof two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there\r\nis nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance\r\nof the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the\r\nmere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear\r\nafter having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of generations.\r\nBut when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the\r\noffspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert in\r\ncharacter to the foreign breed--some say, for a dozen or even a score of\r\ngenerations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a\r\ncommon expression, from one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we\r\nsee, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained\r\nby this remnant of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been\r\ncrossed, but in which BOTH parents have lost some character which their\r\nprogenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce\r\nthe lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for all that we\r\ncan see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any number of\r\ngenerations. When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears\r\nafter a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is,\r\nnot that one individual suddenly takes after an ancestor removed by\r\nsome hundred generations, but that in each successive generation the\r\ncharacter in question has been lying latent, and at last, under unknown\r\nfavourable conditions, is developed. With the barb-pigeon, for instance,\r\nwhich very rarely produces a blue bird, it is probable that there is a\r\nlatent tendency in each generation to produce blue plumage. The abstract\r\nimprobability of such a tendency being transmitted through a vast number\r\nof generations, is not greater than that of quite useless or rudimentary\r\norgans being similarly transmitted. A mere tendency to produce a\r\nrudiment is indeed sometimes thus inherited.\r\n\r\nAs all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from\r\na common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally\r\nvary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more\r\nspecies would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species\r\nwould resemble in certain characters another and distinct species,\r\nthis other species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and\r\npermanent variety. But characters exclusively due to analogous variation\r\nwould probably be of an unimportant nature, for the preservation of\r\nall functionally important characters will have been determined through\r\nnatural selection, in accordance with the different habits of the\r\nspecies. It might further be expected that the species of the same\r\ngenus would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost characters.\r\nAs, however, we do not know the common ancestor of any natural group,\r\nwe cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous characters.\r\nIf, for instance, we did not know that the parent rock-pigeon was not\r\nfeather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether such\r\ncharacters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous\r\nvariations; but we might have inferred that the blue colour was a case\r\nof reversion from the number of the markings, which are correlated with\r\nthis tint, and which would not probably have all appeared together from\r\nsimple variation. More especially we might have inferred this from the\r\nblue colour and the several marks so often appearing when differently\r\ncoloured breeds are crossed. Hence, although under nature it must\r\ngenerally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly\r\nexisting characters, and what are new but analogous variations, yet\r\nwe ought, on our theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a\r\nspecies assuming characters which are already present in other members\r\nof the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due to\r\nthe varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus.\r\nA considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate\r\nbetween two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be ranked\r\nas species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied forms be\r\nconsidered as independently created species, that they have in varying\r\nassumed some of the characters of the others. But the best evidence of\r\nanalogous variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally\r\nconstant in character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble,\r\nin some degree, the same part or organ in an allied species. I have\r\ncollected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under\r\nthe great disadvantage of not being able to give them. I can only repeat\r\nthat such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very remarkable.\r\n\r\nI will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as\r\naffecting any important character, but from occurring in several species\r\nof the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature.\r\nIt is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass sometimes has very\r\ndistinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra.\r\nIt has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from\r\ninquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. The stripe on\r\nthe shoulder is sometimes double, and is very variable in length and\r\noutline. A white ass, but NOT an albino, has been described without\r\neither spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very\r\nobscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan\r\nof Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe.\r\nMr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct\r\nshoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been informed\r\nby Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally striped on the\r\nlegs and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred\r\nlike a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray\r\nhas figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the\r\nhocks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the\r\nspinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL colours;\r\ntransverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one\r\ninstance in a chestnut; a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen\r\nin duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse. My son made a careful\r\nexamination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double\r\nstripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes. I have myself seen a dun\r\nDevonshire pony, and a small dun Welsh pony has been carefully described\r\nto me, both with THREE parallel stripes on each shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so\r\ngenerally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined\r\nthis breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not\r\nconsidered as purely bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are\r\ngenerally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double\r\nand sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is\r\nsometimes striped. The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and\r\nsometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both\r\ngray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have also\r\nreason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W.W. Edwards, that\r\nwith the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the\r\nfoal than in the full-grown animal. I have myself recently bred a foal\r\nfrom a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by\r\na bay English race-horse. This foal, when a week old, was marked on its\r\nhinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark,\r\nzebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped. All the stripes soon\r\ndisappeared completely. Without here entering on further details I may\r\nstate that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses\r\nof very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern\r\nChina; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the\r\nsouth. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest\r\nin duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is\r\nincluded, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,\r\nbelieves that the several breeds of the horse are descended from several\r\naboriginal species, one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the\r\nabove-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun\r\nstock. But this view may be safely rejected, for it is highly improbable\r\nthat the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the\r\nlanky Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the\r\nworld, should have all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\r\nhorse genus. Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse\r\nis particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr. Gosse,\r\nin certain parts of the United States, about nine out of ten mules have\r\nstriped legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any\r\none might have thought that it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.C. Martin,\r\nin his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar\r\nmule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between\r\nthe ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest\r\nof the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In\r\nLord Morton's famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the\r\nhybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the same\r\nmare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the\r\nlegs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most\r\nremarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs\r\nme that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and\r\nthis hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on his\r\nlegs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe,\r\nnevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short\r\nshoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and\r\neven had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect\r\nto this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour\r\nappears from what is commonly called chance, that I was led solely\r\nfrom the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and\r\nhemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occurred\r\nin the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have\r\nseen, answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nWhat now are we to say to these several facts? We see several distinct\r\nspecies of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the\r\nlegs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the horse\r\nwe see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which\r\napproaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the\r\ngenus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change\r\nof form, or by any other new character. We see this tendency to become\r\nstriped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the\r\nmost distinct species. Now observe the case of the several breeds\r\nof pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three\r\nsub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars\r\nand other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish\r\ntint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any\r\nother change of form or character. When the oldest and truest breeds of\r\nvarious colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint\r\nand bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the\r\nmost probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient\r\ncharacters, is--that there is a TENDENCY in the young of each successive\r\ngeneration to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency,\r\nfrom unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in\r\nseveral species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer or\r\nappear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds of\r\npigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how\r\nexactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse\r\ngenus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands on\r\nthousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra, but\r\nperhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of\r\nour domestic horse (whether or not it be descended from one or more wild\r\nstocks) of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that each equine species was independently created,\r\nwill, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a\r\ntendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this\r\nparticular manner, so as often to become striped like the other species\r\nof the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,\r\nwhen crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to\r\nproduce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but\r\nother species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to\r\nreject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown cause. It makes\r\nthe works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon\r\nbelieve with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had\r\nnever lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now\r\nliving on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nOur ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out\r\nof a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part\r\nhas varied. But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison,\r\nthe same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences\r\nbetween varieties of the same species, and the greater differences\r\nbetween species of the same genus. Changed conditions generally induce\r\nmere fluctuating variability, but sometimes they cause direct and\r\ndefinite effects; and these may become strongly marked in the course\r\nof time, though we have not sufficient evidence on this head. Habit in\r\nproducing constitutional peculiarities, and use in strengthening, and\r\ndisuse in weakening and diminishing organs, appear in many cases to have\r\nbeen potent in their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same\r\nmanner, and homologous parts tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts\r\nand in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When\r\none part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from\r\nthe adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved\r\nwithout detriment will be saved. Changes of structure at an early age\r\nmay affect parts subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated\r\nvariation, the nature of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly\r\noccur. Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps\r\narising from such parts not having been closely specialised for any\r\nparticular function, so that their modifications have not been closely\r\nchecked by natural selection. It follows probably from this same cause,\r\nthat organic beings low in the scale are more variable than those\r\nstanding higher in the scale, and which have their whole organisation\r\nmore specialised. Rudimentary organs, from being useless, are not\r\nregulated by natural selection, and hence are variable. Specific\r\ncharacters--that is, the characters which have come to differ since the\r\nseveral species of the same genus branched off from a common parent--are\r\nmore variable than generic characters, or those which have long been\r\ninherited, and have not differed within this same period. In these\r\nremarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still\r\nvariable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but\r\nwe have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies\r\nto the whole individual; for in a district where many species of a\r\ngenus are found--that is, where there has been much former variation and\r\ndifferentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been\r\nactively at work--in that district and among these species, we now find,\r\non an average, most varieties. Secondary sexual characters are highly\r\nvariable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same\r\ngroup. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally\r\nbeen taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the\r\ntwo sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the\r\nseveral species of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an\r\nextraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with\r\nthe same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an\r\nextraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we\r\ncan understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher\r\ndegree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow\r\nprocess, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had\r\ntime to overcome the tendency to further variability and to\r\nreversion to a less modified state. But when a species with an\r\nextraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modified\r\ndescendants--which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring a\r\nlong lapse of time--in this case, natural selection has succeeded in\r\ngiving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner\r\nit may have been developed. Species inheriting nearly the same\r\nconstitution from a common parent, and exposed to similar influences,\r\nnaturally tend to present analogous variations, or these same species\r\nmay occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient\r\nprogenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise from\r\nreversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the\r\nbeautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the\r\noffspring and their parents--and a cause for each must exist--we have\r\nreason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of beneficial\r\ndifferences which has given rise to all the more important modifications\r\nof structure in relation to the habits of each species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY.\r\n\r\n Difficulties of the theory of descent with modification--Absence\r\n or rarity of transitional varieties--Transitions in habits of\r\n life--Diversified habits in the same species--Species with habits\r\n widely different from those of their allies--Organs of extreme\r\n perfection--Modes of transition--Cases of difficulty--Natura non facit\r\n saltum--Organs of small importance--Organs not in all cases absolutely\r\n perfect--The law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence\r\n embraced by the theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of\r\ndifficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are so serious that\r\nto this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in some degree\r\nstaggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only\r\napparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to the theory.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties and objections may be classed under the following\r\nheads: First, why, if species have descended from other species by fine\r\ngradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why\r\nis not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see\r\nthem, well defined?\r\n\r\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance,\r\nthe structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the\r\nmodification of some other animal with widely different habits and\r\nstructure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on\r\nthe one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a\r\ngiraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an organ\r\nso wonderful as the eye?\r\n\r\nThirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural\r\nselection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to make\r\ncells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound\r\nmathematicians?\r\n\r\nFourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile\r\nand producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed,\r\ntheir fertility is unimpaired?\r\n\r\nThe two first heads will be here discussed; some miscellaneous\r\nobjections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the two\r\nsucceeding chapters.\r\n\r\nON THE ABSENCE OR RARITY OF TRANSITIONAL VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable\r\nmodifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to\r\ntake the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved\r\nparent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into\r\ncompetition. Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.\r\nHence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form,\r\nboth the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have\r\nbeen exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of\r\nthe new form.\r\n\r\nBut, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\r\nwhy do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of\r\nthe earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the\r\nchapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will here\r\nonly state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being\r\nincomparably less perfect than is generally supposed. The crust of\r\nthe earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been\r\nimperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit\r\nthe same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many\r\ntransitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north\r\nto south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals\r\nwith closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly\r\nthe same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative\r\nspecies often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and\r\nrarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces\r\nthe other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they\r\nare generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of\r\nstructure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.\r\nBy my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent;\r\nand during the process of modification, each has become adapted to\r\nthe conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and\r\nexterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional varieties\r\nbetween its past and present states. Hence we ought not to expect at\r\nthe present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each\r\nregion, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded\r\nthere in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region, having\r\nintermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking\r\nintermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded\r\nme. But I think it can be in large part explained.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because\r\nan area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long\r\nperiod. Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have been\r\nbroken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in\r\nsuch islands distinct species might have been separately formed without\r\nthe possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate\r\nzones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas\r\nnow continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less\r\ncontinuous and uniform condition than at present. But I will pass\r\nover this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many\r\nperfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas;\r\nthough I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas\r\nnow continuous, has played an important part in the formation of new\r\nspecies, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.\r\n\r\nIn looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,\r\nwe generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then\r\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally\r\ndisappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative\r\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\r\neach. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it\r\nis quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a\r\ncommon alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E.\r\nForbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who\r\nlook at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important\r\nelements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as\r\nclimate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we\r\nbear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would\r\nincrease immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species;\r\nthat nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short,\r\nthat each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the\r\nmost important manner to other organic beings--we see that the range\r\nof the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends\r\non insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on\r\nthe presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is\r\ndestroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species\r\nare already defined objects, not blending one into another by insensible\r\ngradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the\r\nrange of others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species\r\non the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will,\r\nduring fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in\r\nthe nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination;\r\nand thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nAs allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area,\r\nare generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range,\r\nwith a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which\r\nthey become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not\r\nessentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to\r\nboth; and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area,\r\nwe shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third\r\nvariety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety,\r\nconsequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and\r\nlesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds\r\ngood with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking\r\ninstances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between\r\nwell-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from\r\ninformation given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston,\r\nthat generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms\r\noccur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they\r\nconnect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude\r\nthat varieties linking two other varieties together generally have\r\nexisted in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can\r\nunderstand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very\r\nlong periods: why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and\r\ndisappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\r\n\r\nFor any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,\r\nrun a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large\r\nnumbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be\r\neminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both\r\nsides of it. But it is a far more important consideration, that during\r\nthe process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed\r\nto be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which\r\nexist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great\r\nadvantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers\r\nin a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers\r\nwill have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting\r\nfurther favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than\r\nwill the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more\r\ncommon forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the\r\nless common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.\r\nIt is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common\r\nspecies in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on\r\nan average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer\r\nspecies. I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of\r\nsheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a\r\nsecond to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to the wide\r\nplains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal\r\nsteadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances\r\nin this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the\r\nmountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the\r\nsmall holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently\r\nthe improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the\r\nless improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally\r\nexisted in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each\r\nother, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined\r\nobjects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\r\nvarying and intermediate links: first, because new varieties are very\r\nslowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection\r\ncan do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations\r\noccur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can\r\nbe better filled by some modification of some one or more of its\r\ninhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate,\r\nor on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in\r\na still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming\r\nslowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones\r\nacting and reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at\r\nany one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight\r\nmodifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly\r\nwe do see.\r\n\r\nSecondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent\r\nperiod as isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially\r\namong the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have\r\nseparately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative\r\nspecies. In this case, intermediate varieties between the several\r\nrepresentative species and their common parent, must formerly have\r\nexisted within each isolated portion of the land, but these links\r\nduring the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and\r\nexterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different\r\nportions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it\r\nis probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but\r\nthey will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate\r\nvarieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know\r\nof the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,\r\nand likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones\r\nin lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From\r\nthis cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental\r\nextermination; and during the process of further modification through\r\nnatural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted\r\nby the forms which they connect; for these, from existing in greater\r\nnumbers will, in the aggregate, present more varieties, and thus be\r\nfurther improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.\r\n\r\nLastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be\r\ntrue, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all\r\nthe species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but the\r\nvery process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often\r\nremarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links.\r\nConsequently evidence of their former existence could be found only\r\namong fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall attempt to show\r\nin a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.\r\n\r\nON THE ORIGIN AND TRANSITION OF ORGANIC BEINGS WITH PECULIAR HABITS AND\r\nSTRUCTURE.\r\n\r\nIt has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for\r\ninstance, could a land carnivorous animal have been converted into one\r\nwith aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional\r\nstate have subsisted? It would be easy to show that there now exist\r\ncarnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from strictly\r\nterrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists by a struggle for\r\nlife, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its place in nature.\r\nLook at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet,\r\nand which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail;\r\nduring summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the\r\nlong winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats\r\non mice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it\r\nhad been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been\r\nconverted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more\r\ndifficult to answer. Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.\r\n\r\nHere, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for, out\r\nof the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only\r\none or two instances of transitional habits and structures in allied\r\nspecies; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in\r\nthe same species. And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list\r\nof such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular\r\ncase like that of the bat.\r\n\r\nLook at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from\r\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as\r\nSir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies\r\nrather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the\r\nso-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and\r\neven the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which\r\nserves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to\r\nan astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each\r\nstructure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by\r\nenabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more\r\nquickly, or, as there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger\r\nfrom occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the\r\nstructure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive\r\nunder all possible conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change,\r\nlet other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones\r\nbecome modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some,\r\nat least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become\r\nexterminated, unless they also become modified and improved in structure\r\nin a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty,\r\nmore especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued\r\npreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes,\r\neach modification being useful, each being propagated, until, by the\r\naccumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect\r\nso-called flying squirrel was produced.\r\n\r\nNow look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which was\r\nformerly ranked among bats, but is now believed to belong to the\r\nInsectivora. An extremely wide flank-membrane stretches from the corners\r\nof the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the elongated\r\nfingers. This flank-membrane is furnished with an extensor muscle.\r\nAlthough no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the\r\nair, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there\r\nis no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that\r\neach was developed in the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding\r\nsquirrels; each grade of structure having been useful to its possessor.\r\nNor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it\r\npossible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the\r\nGaleopithecus might have been greatly lengthened by natural selection;\r\nand this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would\r\nhave converted the animal into a bat. In certain bats in which the\r\nwing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the tail and\r\nincludes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally\r\nfitted for gliding through the air rather than for flight.\r\n\r\nIf about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would have\r\nventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used their wings\r\nsolely as flappers, like the logger headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton);\r\nas fins in the water and as front legs on the land, like the penguin;\r\nas sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the\r\napteryx? Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under\r\nthe conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a\r\nstruggle: but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible\r\nconditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the\r\ngrades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the\r\nresult of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired\r\ntheir perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what diversified\r\nmeans of transition are at least possible.\r\n\r\nSeeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the\r\nCrustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that\r\nwe have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified\r\ntypes, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that\r\nflying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and\r\nturning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified\r\ninto perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who would\r\nhave ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been\r\ninhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of\r\nflight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by other\r\nfish?\r\n\r\nWhen we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,\r\nas the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals\r\ndisplaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have\r\nsurvived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by their\r\nsuccessors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through natural\r\nselection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional states between\r\nstructures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have\r\nbeen developed at an early period in great numbers and under many\r\nsubordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of\r\nthe flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true\r\nflight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for\r\ntaking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water,\r\nuntil their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection,\r\nso as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in\r\nthe battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with\r\ntransitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be\r\nless, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of\r\nspecies with fully developed structures.\r\n\r\nI will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and of\r\nchanged habits, in the individuals of the same species. In either case\r\nit would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure of the\r\nanimal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its several\r\nhabits. It is, however, difficult to decide and immaterial for us,\r\nwhether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or\r\nwhether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both\r\nprobably often occurring almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed\r\nhabits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British\r\ninsects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial\r\nsubstances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given:\r\nI have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in\r\nSouth America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another,\r\nlike a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of\r\nwater, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own\r\ncountry the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches,\r\nalmost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills small birds by\r\nblows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering the\r\nseeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In\r\nNorth America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with\r\nwidely open mouth, thus catching, almost like a whale, insects in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs we sometimes see individuals following habits different from those\r\nproper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, we\r\nmight expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to\r\nnew species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either\r\nslightly or considerably modified from that of their type. And such\r\ninstances occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation be\r\ngiven than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing insects\r\nin the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers\r\nwhich feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase\r\ninsects on the wing. On the plains of La Plata, where hardly a tree\r\ngrows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which has two toes\r\nbefore and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed tail-feathers,\r\nsufficiently stiff to support the bird in a vertical position on a post,\r\nbut not so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers, and a straight, strong\r\nbeak. The beak, however, is not so straight or so strong as in the\r\ntypical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore into wood. Hence\r\nthis Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its structure, is a\r\nwoodpecker. Even in such trifling characters as the colouring, the harsh\r\ntone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its close blood-relationship\r\nto our common woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as I can assert, not\r\nonly from my own observations, but from those of the accurate Azara, in\r\ncertain large districts it does not climb trees, and it makes its\r\nnest in holes in banks! In certain other districts, however, this same\r\nwoodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bores holes in\r\nthe trunk for its nest. I may mention as another illustration of the\r\nvaried habits of this genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been described\r\nby De Saussure as boring holes into hard wood in order to lay up a store\r\nof acorns.\r\n\r\nPetrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, but, in the quiet\r\nsounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general\r\nhabits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner of swimming\r\nand of flying when made to take flight, would be mistaken by any one for\r\nan auk or a grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with\r\nmany parts of its organisation profoundly modified in relation to its\r\nnew habits of life; whereas the woodpecker of La Plata has had its\r\nstructure only slightly modified. In the case of the water-ouzel, the\r\nacutest observer, by examining its dead body, would never have suspected\r\nits sub-aquatic habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the thrush\r\nfamily, subsists by diving,--using its wings under water and\r\ngrasping stones with its feet. All the members of the great order of\r\nHymenopterous insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes,\r\nwhich Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it\r\noften enters the water and dives about by the use not of its legs but of\r\nits wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath the surface; yet\r\nit exhibits no modification in structure in accordance with its abnormal\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must\r\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\r\nhabits and structure not in agreement. What can be plainer than that the\r\nwebbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet there are\r\nupland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the water; and no one\r\nexcept Audubon, has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes\r\nwebbed, alight on the surface of the ocean. On the other hand, grebes\r\nand coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered\r\nby membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes, not furnished\r\nwith membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking over swamps\r\nand floating plants. The water-hen and landrail are members of this\r\norder, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and the second is\r\nnearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and\r\nmany others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding\r\nchange of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to\r\nhave become almost rudimentary in function, though not in structure.\r\nIn the frigate-bird, the deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows\r\nthat structure has begun to change.\r\n\r\nHe who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say,\r\nthat in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one\r\ntype to take the place of one belonging to another type; but this seems\r\nto me only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in\r\nthe struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection,\r\nwill acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to\r\nincrease in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little,\r\neither in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some\r\nother inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that\r\ninhabitant, however different that may be from its own place. Hence it\r\nwill cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds\r\nwith webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on the\r\nwater, that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows\r\ninstead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a\r\ntree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera,\r\nand petrels with the habits of auks.\r\n\r\nORGANS OF EXTREME PERFECTION AND COMPLICATION.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for\r\nadjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different\r\namounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic\r\naberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely\r\nconfess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the\r\nsun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind\r\ndeclared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei,\r\nas every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells\r\nme, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one\r\ncomplex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to\r\nits possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies\r\nand the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case;\r\nand if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing\r\nconditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and\r\ncomplex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by\r\nour imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.\r\nHow a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than\r\nhow life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest\r\norganisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving\r\nlight, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements\r\nin their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves,\r\nendowed with this special sensibility.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the gradations through which an organ in any species\r\nhas been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal\r\nprogenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced\r\nto look to other species and genera of the same group, that is to the\r\ncollateral descendants from the same parent-form, in order to see what\r\ngradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having\r\nbeen transmitted in an unaltered or little altered condition. But the\r\nstate of the same organ in distinct classes may incidentally throw light\r\non the steps by which it has been perfected.\r\n\r\nThe simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic\r\nnerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but\r\nwithout any lens or other refractive body. We may, however, according\r\nto M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find aggregates of\r\npigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any\r\nnerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple\r\nnature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish\r\nlight from darkness. In certain star-fishes, small depressions in the\r\nlayer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are filled, as described by\r\nthe author just quoted, with transparent gelatinous matter, projecting\r\nwith a convex surface, like the cornea in the higher animals. He\r\nsuggests that this serves not to form an image, but only to concentrate\r\nthe luminous rays and render their perception more easy. In this\r\nconcentration of the rays we gain the first and by far the most\r\nimportant step towards the formation of a true, picture-forming eye; for\r\nwe have only to place the naked extremity of the optic nerve, which in\r\nsome of the lower animals lies deeply buried in the body, and in\r\nsome near the surface, at the right distance from the concentrating\r\napparatus, and an image will be formed on it.\r\n\r\nIn the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic nerve\r\nsimply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a sort of\r\npupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance. With insects\r\nit is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of their great\r\ncompound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include curiously\r\nmodified nervous filaments. But these organs in the Articulata are so\r\nmuch diversified that Muller formerly made three main classes with seven\r\nsubdivisions, besides a fourth main class of aggregated simple eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly, with\r\nrespect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of structure in\r\nthe eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in mind how small the\r\nnumber of all living forms must be in comparison with those which have\r\nbecome extinct, the difficulty ceases to be very great in believing that\r\nnatural selection may have converted the simple apparatus of an optic\r\nnerve, coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into\r\nan optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the\r\nArticulata class.\r\n\r\nHe who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step further,\r\nif he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of facts,\r\notherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of modification\r\nthrough natural selection; he ought to admit that a structure even as\r\nperfect as an eagle's eye might thus be formed, although in this case\r\nhe does not know the transitional states. It has been objected that in\r\norder to modify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument,\r\nmany changes would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is\r\nassumed, could not be done through natural selection; but as I have\r\nattempted to show in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it is\r\nnot necessary to suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous,\r\nif they were extremely slight and gradual. Different kinds of\r\nmodification would, also, serve for the same general purpose: as Mr.\r\nWallace has remarked, \"If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it\r\nmay be amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration of\r\ndensity; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not converge\r\nto a point, then any increased regularity of curvature will be an\r\nimprovement. So the contraction of the iris and the muscular\r\nmovements of the eye are neither of them essential to vision, but only\r\nimprovements which might have been added and perfected at any stage of\r\nthe construction of the instrument.\" Within the highest division of\r\nthe animal kingdom, namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye\r\nso simple, that it consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of\r\ntransparent skin, furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but\r\ndestitute of any other apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has\r\nremarked, \"The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very\r\ngreat.\" It is a significant fact that even in man, according to the high\r\nauthority of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the\r\nembryo by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold\r\nof the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic subcutaneous\r\ntissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding the\r\nformation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely perfect\r\ncharacters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the\r\nimagination; but I have felt the difficulty far to keenly to be\r\nsurprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural\r\nselection to so startling a length.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope.\r\nWe know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued\r\nefforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the\r\neye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this\r\ninference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator\r\nworks by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the\r\neye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick\r\nlayer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a\r\nnerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this\r\nlayer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate\r\ninto layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different\r\ndistances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly\r\nchanging in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power,\r\nrepresented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always\r\nintently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and\r\ncarefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way\r\nor degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each\r\nnew state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be\r\npreserved until a better is produced, and then the old ones to be all\r\ndestroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration,\r\ngeneration will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection\r\nwill pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process\r\ngo on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of\r\nindividuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical\r\ninstrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the\r\nworks of the Creator are to those of man?\r\n\r\nMODES Of TRANSITION.\r\n\r\nIf it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which\r\ncould not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight\r\nmodifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find\r\nout no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know\r\nthe transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated\r\nspecies, around which, according to the theory, there has been much\r\nextinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of\r\na class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally\r\nformed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the class\r\nhave been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional\r\ngrades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to\r\nvery ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.\r\n\r\nWe should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not\r\nhave been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases\r\ncould be given among the lower animals of the same organ performing\r\nat the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the larva of the\r\ndragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal respires,\r\ndigests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside\r\nout, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire.\r\nIn such cases natural selection might specialise, if any advantage\r\nwere thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had previously\r\nperformed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by insensible\r\nsteps greatly change its nature. Many plants are known which regularly\r\nproduce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and if such\r\nplants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected\r\nwith comparative suddenness in the character of the species. It is,\r\nhowever, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant\r\nwere originally differentiated by finely graduated steps, which may\r\nstill be followed in some few cases.\r\n\r\nAgain, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very different\r\nforms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same\r\nfunction, and this is an extremely important means of transition: to\r\ngive one instance--there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe\r\nthe air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free\r\nair in their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly\r\nvascular partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of\r\nair. To give another instance from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb\r\nby three distinct means, by spirally twining, by clasping a support with\r\ntheir sensitive tendrils, and by the emission of aerial rootlets; these\r\nthree means are usually found in distinct groups, but some few species\r\nexhibit two of the means, or even all three, combined in the same\r\nindividual. In all such cases one of the two organs might readily be\r\nmodified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being aided during\r\nthe progress of modification by the other organ; and then this other\r\norgan might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be\r\nwholly obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because\r\nit shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\r\nconstructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into\r\none for a widely different purpose, namely respiration. The swim-bladder\r\nhas, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs\r\nof certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swim-bladder is\r\nhomologous, or \"ideally similar\" in position and structure with the\r\nlungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that the swim-bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or\r\nan organ used exclusively for respiration.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals\r\nwith true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient\r\nand unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or\r\nswim-bladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting\r\ndescription of these parts, understand the strange fact that every\r\nparticle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the\r\norifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,\r\nnotwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis\r\nis closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly\r\ndisappeared--but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the neck and\r\nthe loop-like course of the arteries still mark their former position.\r\nBut it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have\r\nbeen gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinct purpose:\r\nfor instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are developed\r\nfrom the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in this great\r\nclass organs which once served for respiration have been actually\r\nconverted into organs for flight.\r\n\r\nIn considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind\r\nthe probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will\r\ngive another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of\r\nskin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means\r\nof a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within\r\nthe sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of\r\nthe body and of the sack, together with the small frena, serving for\r\nrespiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand,\r\nhave no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack,\r\nwithin the well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same relative\r\nposition with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which freely\r\ncommunicate with the circulatory lacunae of the sack and body, and which\r\nhave been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiae. Now I\r\nthink no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are\r\nstrictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they\r\ngraduate into each other. Therefore it need not be doubted that the two\r\nlittle folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but\r\nwhich, likewise, very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have\r\nbeen gradually converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply\r\nthrough an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive\r\nglands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have\r\nsuffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would\r\never have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had\r\noriginally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed\r\nout of the sack?\r\n\r\nThere is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the\r\nacceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This has\r\nlately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the United\r\nStates. It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction\r\nat a very early age, before they have acquired their perfect characters;\r\nand if this power became thoroughly well developed in a species, it\r\nseems probable that the adult stage of development would sooner or later\r\nbe lost; and in this case, especially if the larva differed much from\r\nthe mature form, the character of the species would be greatly changed\r\nand degraded. Again, not a few animals, after arriving at maturity, go\r\non changing in character during nearly their whole lives. With mammals,\r\nfor instance, the form of the skull is often much altered with age, of\r\nwhich Dr. Murie has given some striking instances with seals. Every\r\none knows how the horns of stags become more and more branched, and the\r\nplumes of some birds become more finely developed, as they grow older.\r\nProfessor Cope states that the teeth of certain lizards change much in\r\nshape with advancing years. With crustaceans not only many trivial,\r\nbut some important parts assume a new character, as recorded by Fritz\r\nMuller, after maturity. In all such cases--and many could be given--if\r\nthe age for reproduction were retarded, the character of the species, at\r\nleast in its adult state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that\r\nthe previous and earlier stages of development would in some cases be\r\nhurried through and finally lost. Whether species have often or ever\r\nbeen modified through this comparatively sudden mode of transition, I\r\ncan form no opinion; but if this has occurred, it is probable that the\r\ndifferences between the young and the mature, and between the mature and\r\nthe old, were primordially acquired by graduated steps.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nAlthough we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ\r\ncould not have been produced by successive, small, transitional\r\ngradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty occur.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often\r\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but\r\nthis case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs of\r\nfishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is impossible\r\nto conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced. But\r\nthis is not surprising, for we do not even know of what use they are.\r\nIn the gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt serve as powerful means of\r\ndefence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet in the ray, as observed\r\nby Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail manifests but little\r\nelectricity, even when the animal is greatly irritated; so little that\r\nit can hardly be of any use for the above purposes. Moreover, in the\r\nray, besides the organ just referred to, there is, as Dr. R. McDonnell\r\nhas shown, another organ near the head, not known to be electrical, but\r\nwhich appears to be the real homologue of the electric battery in the\r\ntorpedo. It is generally admitted that there exists between these organs\r\nand ordinary muscle a close analogy, in intimate structure, in the\r\ndistribution of the nerves, and in the manner in which they are acted\r\non by various reagents. It should, also, be especially observed that\r\nmuscular contraction is accompanied by an electrical discharge; and,\r\nas Dr. Radcliffe insists, \"in the electrical apparatus of the torpedo\r\nduring rest, there would seem to be a charge in every respect like that\r\nwhich is met with in muscle and nerve during the rest, and the discharge\r\nof the torpedo, instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of\r\nthe discharge which attends upon the action of muscle and motor nerve.\"\r\nBeyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation; but as\r\nwe know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we know nothing\r\nabout the habits and structure of the progenitors of the existing\r\nelectric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain that no\r\nserviceable transitions are possible by which these organs might have\r\nbeen gradually developed.\r\n\r\nThese organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious\r\ndifficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which\r\nseveral are widely remote in their affinities. When the same organ is\r\nfound in several members of the same class, especially if in members\r\nhaving very different habits of life, we may generally attribute its\r\npresence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some\r\nof the members to loss through disuse or natural selection. So that, if\r\nthe electric organs had been inherited from some one ancient progenitor,\r\nwe might have expected that all electric fishes would have been\r\nspecially related to each other; but this is far from the case. Nor does\r\ngeology at all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly possessed\r\nelectric organs, which their modified descendants have now lost. But\r\nwhen we look at the subject more closely, we find in the several fishes\r\nprovided with electric organs, that these are situated in different\r\nparts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in the\r\narrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process or\r\nmeans by which the electricity is excited--and lastly, in being supplied\r\nwith nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is perhaps\r\nthe most important of all the differences. Hence in the several\r\nfishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as\r\nhomologous, but only as analogous in function. Consequently there is\r\nno reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common\r\nprogenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely resembled\r\neach other in all respects. Thus the difficulty of an organ, apparently\r\nthe same, arising in several remotely allied species, disappears,\r\nleaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty: namely, by what\r\ngraduated steps these organs have been developed in each separate group\r\nof fishes.\r\n\r\nThe luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to widely\r\ndifferent families, and which are situated in different parts of the\r\nbody, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost\r\nexactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other similar cases\r\ncould be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of\r\na mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland,\r\nis apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote\r\nas is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not\r\nhomologous. In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the\r\nscale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar\r\norgans, it will be found that although the general appearance and\r\nfunction of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences\r\nbetween them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of\r\nCephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully\r\nalike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance\r\ncan be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has\r\nadvanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to\r\nsee the force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of\r\ntransparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing\r\nan image at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial\r\nresemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of\r\ncuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen's\r\nadmirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible\r\nfor me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points\r\nof difference. The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists\r\nof two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having\r\na very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the\r\nvertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of\r\nthe elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within\r\nthe membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as different\r\nas it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence it is not\r\na little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be\r\nemployed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It\r\nis, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case could\r\nhave been developed through the natural selection of successive slight\r\nvariations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is clearly\r\npossible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure in the\r\nvisual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance\r\nwith this view of their manner of formation. As two men have sometimes\r\nindependently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing\r\ncases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each\r\nbeing, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced\r\nsimilar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic\r\nbeings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from\r\na common progenitor.\r\n\r\nFritz Muller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this\r\nvolume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of\r\nargument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species,\r\npossessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the\r\nwater. In two of these families, which were more especially examined by\r\nMuller, and which are nearly related to each other, the species agree\r\nmost closely in all important characters: namely in their sense organs,\r\ncirculating systems, in the position of the tufts of hair within\r\ntheir complex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of the\r\nwater-breathing branchiae, even to the microscopical hooks by which they\r\nare cleansed. Hence it might have been expected that in the few species\r\nbelonging to both families which live on the land, the equally important\r\nair-breathing apparatus would have been the same; for why should this\r\none apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made to differ,\r\nwhile all the other important organs were closely similar, or rather,\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nFritz Muller argues that this close similarity in so many points\r\nof structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be\r\naccounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the vast\r\nmajority of the species in the above two families, as well as most\r\nother crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the\r\nhighest degree that their common progenitor should have been adapted for\r\nbreathing air. Muller was thus led carefully to examine the apparatus in\r\nthe air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in each in several\r\nimportant points, as in the position of the orifices, in the manner in\r\nwhich they are opened and closed, and in some accessory details. Now\r\nsuch differences are intelligible, and might even have been expected, on\r\nthe supposition that species belonging to distinct families had slowly\r\nbecome adapted to live more and more out of water, and to breathe the\r\nair. For these species, from belonging to distinct families, would have\r\ndiffered to a certain extent, and in accordance with the principle that\r\nthe nature of each variation depends on two factors, viz., the nature of\r\nthe organism and that of the surrounding conditions, their variability\r\nassuredly would not have been exactly the same. Consequently natural\r\nselection would have had different materials or variations to work on,\r\nin order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures\r\nthus acquired would almost necessarily have differed. On the hypothesis\r\nof separate acts of creation the whole case remains unintelligible. This\r\nline of argument seems to have had great weight in leading Fritz Muller\r\nto accept the views maintained by me in this volume.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparede, has\r\nargued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result. He\r\nshows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridae), belonging to distinct\r\nsub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers. These\r\norgans must have been independently developed, as they could not have\r\nbeen inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several groups they\r\nare formed by the modification of the fore legs, of the hind legs, of\r\nthe maxillae or lips, and of appendages on the under side of the hind\r\npart of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same function\r\nperformed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by organs in\r\nappearance, though not in development, closely similar. On the other\r\nhand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same end should\r\nbe gained, even sometimes in the case of closely related beings, by the\r\nmost diversified means. How differently constructed is the feathered\r\nwing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat; and still more so\r\nthe four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of a fly, and the two wings\r\nwith the elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells are made to open and shut,\r\nbut on what a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the long\r\nrow of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple ligament of\r\na Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their minuteness, by their capsule\r\nbeing converted into a light balloon-like envelope, by being embedded\r\nin pulp or flesh, formed of the most diverse parts, and rendered\r\nnutritious, as well as conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and\r\nbe devoured by birds, by having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and\r\nserrated awns, so as to adhere to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being\r\nfurnished with wings and plumes, as different in shape as they are\r\nelegant in structure, so as to be wafted by every breeze. I will give\r\none other instance: for this subject of the same end being gained by the\r\nmost diversified means well deserves attention. Some authors maintain\r\nthat organic beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of\r\nmere variety, almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature is\r\nincredible. With plants having separated sexes, and with those in which,\r\nthough hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously fall on the\r\nstigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation. With several\r\nkinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and\r\nincoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the\r\nstigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived. An\r\nalmost equally simple, though very different plan occurs in many plants\r\nin which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar, and is\r\nconsequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen from the\r\nanthers to the stigma.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number of\r\ncontrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in essentially the\r\nsame manner, but entailing changes in every part of the flower. The\r\nnectar may be stored in variously shaped receptacles, with the\r\nstamens and pistils modified in many ways, sometimes forming trap-like\r\ncontrivances, and sometimes capable of neatly adapted movements through\r\nirritability or elasticity. From such structures we may advance till we\r\ncome to such a case of extraordinary adaptation as that lately described\r\nby Dr. Cruger in the Coryanthes. This orchid has part of its labellum or\r\nlower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost\r\npure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above\r\nit; and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a spout on\r\none side. The basal part of the labellum stands over the bucket, and is\r\nitself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two lateral entrances;\r\nwithin this chamber there are curious fleshy ridges. The most ingenious\r\nman, if he had not witnessed what takes place, could never have imagined\r\nwhat purpose all these parts serve. But Dr. Cruger saw crowds of large\r\nhumble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order\r\nto suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the\r\nbucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket,\r\nand their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were\r\ncompelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or\r\noverflow. Dr. Cruger saw a \"continual procession\" of bees thus crawling\r\nout of their involuntary bath. The passage is narrow, and is roofed over\r\nby the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its\r\nback against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the\r\npollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the\r\nbee which first happens to crawl out through the passage of a lately\r\nexpanded flower, and are thus carried away. Dr. Cruger sent me a flower\r\nin spirits of wine, with a bee which he had killed before it had quite\r\ncrawled out, with a pollen-mass still fastened to its back. When the\r\nbee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a\r\nsecond time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then\r\ncrawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into\r\ncontact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is\r\nfertilised. Now at last we see the full use of every part of the flower,\r\nof the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which\r\nprevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through\r\nthe spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and\r\nthe viscid stigma.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely,\r\nthe Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is\r\nequally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes,\r\nin order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch\r\na long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the\r\nantenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration\r\nto a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a\r\nspring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the\r\nright direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the\r\nbee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in\r\nthis orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it\r\nis brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to\r\nbreak certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting\r\nfertilisation.\r\n\r\nHow, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other\r\ninstances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the\r\nmultifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no doubt is, as\r\nalready remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from\r\neach other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the\r\nsame exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through natural\r\nselection for the same general purpose will not be the same. We should\r\nalso bear in mind that every highly developed organism has passed\r\nthrough many changes; and that each modified structure tends to be\r\ninherited, so that each modification will not readily be quite lost,\r\nbut may be again and again further altered. Hence, the structure of each\r\npart of each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the sum of\r\nmany inherited changes, through which the species has passed during its\r\nsuccessive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of life.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to\r\nconjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their\r\npresent state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and\r\nknown forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how\r\nrarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is\r\nknown to lead. It is certainly true, that new organs appearing as if\r\ncreated for some special purpose rarely or never appear in any being; as\r\nindeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in natural\r\nhistory of \"Natura non facit saltum.\" We meet with this admission in the\r\nwritings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards\r\nhas well expressed it, \"Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in\r\ninnovation.\" Why, on the theory of Creation, should there be so much\r\nvariety and so little real novelty? Why should all the parts and organs\r\nof many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately\r\ncreated for its own proper place in nature, be so commonly linked\r\ntogether by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a sudden leap\r\nfrom structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can\r\nclearly understand why she should not; for natural selection acts only\r\nby taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take\r\na great and sudden leap, but must advance by the short and sure, though\r\nslow steps.\r\n\r\nORGANS OF LITTLE APPARENT IMPORTANCE, AS AFFECTED BY NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of the\r\nfittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals,\r\nI have sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or\r\nformation of parts of little importance; almost as great, though of\r\na very different kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole\r\neconomy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would\r\nbe of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of\r\nvery trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of\r\nits flesh, the colour of the skin and hair of quadrupeds, which, from\r\nbeing correlated with constitutional differences, or from determining\r\nthe attacks of insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural\r\nselection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially\r\nconstructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this\r\ncould have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight\r\nmodifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object\r\nas to drive away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive\r\neven in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of\r\ncattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their\r\npower of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which\r\ncould by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be\r\nable to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is\r\nnot that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some\r\nrare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their\r\nstrength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so\r\nwell enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from\r\nbeasts of prey.\r\n\r\nOrgans now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of\r\nhigh importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly\r\nperfected at a former period, have been transmitted to existing species\r\nin nearly the same state, although now of very slight use; but any\r\nactually injurious deviations in their structure would of course have\r\nbeen checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of\r\nlocomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and\r\nuse for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or\r\nmodified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus\r\naccounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic\r\nanimal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of\r\npurposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in\r\nturning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in this latter\r\nrespect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double\r\nstill more quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance to\r\ncharacters, and in believing that they have been developed through\r\nnatural selection. We must by no means overlook the effects of the\r\ndefinite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate degree on the\r\nnature of the conditions, of the tendency to reversion to long-lost\r\ncharacters, of the complex laws of growth, such as of correlation,\r\ncomprehension, of the pressure of one part on another, etc., and finally\r\nof sexual selection, by which characters of use to one sex are often\r\ngained and then transmitted more or less perfectly to the other sex,\r\nthough of no use to the sex. But structures thus indirectly gained,\r\nalthough at first of no advantage to a species, may subsequently\r\nhave been taken advantage of by its modified descendants, under new\r\nconditions of life and newly acquired habits.\r\n\r\nIf green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there\r\nwere many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought\r\nthat the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this\r\ntree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was\r\na character of importance, and had been acquired through natural\r\nselection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual\r\nselection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest\r\ntrees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the\r\nends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest\r\nservice to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees\r\nwhich are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe from\r\nthe distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South\r\nAmerica, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes\r\non the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and\r\nsubsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as\r\nit underwent further modification and became a climber. The naked skin\r\non the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation\r\nfor wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due\r\nto the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in\r\ndrawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the\r\nclean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls\r\nof young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding\r\nparturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable\r\nfor this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and\r\nreptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that\r\nthis structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken\r\nadvantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nWe are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation or\r\nindividual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of this\r\nby reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our domesticated\r\nanimals in different countries, more especially in the less civilized\r\ncountries, where there has been but little methodical selection. Animals\r\nkept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for\r\ntheir own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to natural\r\nselection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would\r\nsucceed best under different climates. With cattle susceptibility to the\r\nattacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be\r\npoisoned by certain plants; so that even colour would be thus subjected\r\nto the action of natural selection. Some observers are convinced that a\r\ndamp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the\r\nhorns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds;\r\nand a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from\r\nexercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then\r\nby the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and the head would\r\nprobably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect\r\nby pressure the shape of certain parts of the young in the womb. The\r\nlaborious breathing necessary in high regions tends, as we have\r\ngood reason to believe, to increase the size of the chest; and again\r\ncorrelation would come into play. The effects of lessened exercise,\r\ntogether with abundant food, on the whole organisation is probably still\r\nmore important, and this, as H. von Nathusius has lately shown in\r\nhis excellent Treatise, is apparently one chief cause of the great\r\nmodification which the breeds of swine have undergone. But we are far\r\ntoo ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several\r\nknown and unknown causes of variation; and I have made these remarks\r\nonly to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic\r\ndifferences of our several domestic breeds, which nevertheless are\r\ngenerally admitted to have arisen through ordinary generation from\r\none or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too much stress on\r\nour ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences\r\nbetween true species.\r\n\r\nUTILITARIAN DOCTRINE, HOW FAR TRUE: BEAUTY, HOW ACQUIRED.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately\r\nmade by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every\r\ndetail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.\r\nThey believe that many structures have been created for the sake of\r\nbeauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond\r\nthe scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety,\r\na view already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely\r\nfatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures are now of no\r\ndirect use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to\r\ntheir progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed\r\nsolely for beauty or variety. No doubt the definite action of changed\r\nconditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified,\r\nhave all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of\r\nany advantage thus gained. But a still more important consideration is\r\nthat the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due\r\nto inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well\r\nfitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close\r\nand direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can\r\nhardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the\r\nfrigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe\r\nthat the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the\r\nhorse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of\r\nspecial use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures\r\nto inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the\r\nprogenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as they now\r\nare to the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe that the\r\nprogenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five\r\ntoes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to\r\nbelieve that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and\r\nbat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably\r\nthrough the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient\r\nfish-like progenitor of the whole class. It is scarcely possible to\r\ndecide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change,\r\nas the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important\r\nexceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature\r\neither now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the belief that organic beings have been created\r\nbeautiful for the delight of man--a belief which it has been pronounced\r\nis subversive of my whole theory--I may first remark that the sense of\r\nbeauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of\r\nany real quality in the admired object; and that the idea of what is\r\nbeautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in\r\nthe men of different races admiring an entirely different standard of\r\nbeauty in their women. If beautiful objects had been created solely for\r\nman's gratification, it ought to be shown that before man appeared\r\nthere was less beauty on the face of the earth than since he came on the\r\nstage. Were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene epoch,\r\nand the gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period, created\r\nthat man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few objects\r\nare more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae:\r\nwere these created that they might be examined and admired under the\r\nhigher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case, and\r\nin many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of growth. Flowers\r\nrank among the most beautiful productions of nature; but they have\r\nbeen rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green leaves, and in\r\nconsequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may be easily\r\nobserved by insects. I have come to this conclusion from finding it an\r\ninvariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the wind it never\r\nhas a gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually produce two\r\nkinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to attract insects;\r\nthe other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar, and never visited\r\nby insects. Hence, we may conclude that, if insects had not been\r\ndeveloped on the face of the earth, our plants would not have been\r\ndecked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only such poor\r\nflowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on grasses,\r\nspinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised through the agency\r\nof the wind. A similar line of argument holds good with fruits; that\r\na ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing to the eye as to the\r\npalate--that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the\r\nscarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects--will be admitted by\r\neveryone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and\r\nbeasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds\r\ndisseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet found\r\nno exception to the rule that seeds are always thus disseminated when\r\nembedded within a fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or\r\npulpy envelope), if it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered\r\nconspicuous by being white or black.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male\r\nanimals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and\r\nmammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been\r\nrendered beautiful for beauty's sake. But this has been effected through\r\nsexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males having been\r\ncontinually preferred by the females, and not for the delight of man. So\r\nit is with the music of birds. We may infer from all this that a nearly\r\nsimilar taste for beautiful colours and for musical sounds runs through\r\na large part of the animal kingdom. When the female is as beautifully\r\ncoloured as the male, which is not rarely the case with birds and\r\nbutterflies, the cause apparently lies in the colours acquired through\r\nsexual selection having been transmitted to both sexes, instead of to\r\nthe males alone. How the sense of beauty in its simplest form--that is,\r\nthe reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours, forms\r\nand sounds--was first developed in the mind of man and of the lower\r\nanimals, is a very obscure subject. The same sort of difficulty is\r\npresented if we enquire how it is that certain flavours and odours give\r\npleasure, and others displeasure. Habit in all these cases appears\r\nto have come to a certain extent into play; but there must be some\r\nfundamental cause in the constitution of the nervous system in each\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nNatural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a species\r\nexclusively for the good of another species; though throughout\r\nnature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by the\r\nstructures of others. But natural selection can and does often produce\r\nstructures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the fang\r\nof the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs\r\nare deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be\r\nproved that any part of the structure of any one species had been\r\nformed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my\r\ntheory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\r\nAlthough many statements may be found in works on natural history to\r\nthis effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It\r\nis admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence\r\nand for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at\r\nthe same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely,\r\nto warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the\r\nend of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed\r\nmouse. It is a much more probable view that the rattlesnake uses its\r\nrattle, the cobra expands its frill and the puff-adder swells while\r\nhissing so loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds and\r\nbeasts which are known to attack even the most venomous species. Snakes\r\nact on the same principle which makes the hen ruffle her feathers and\r\nexpand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens. But I have not\r\nspace here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour to\r\nfrighten away their enemies.\r\n\r\nNatural selection will never produce in a being any structure more\r\ninjurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts\r\nsolely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as Paley\r\nhas remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury\r\nto its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil\r\ncaused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous. After\r\nthe lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes\r\nto be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will\r\nbecome extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\r\n\r\nNatural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as,\r\nor slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country\r\nwith which it comes into competition. And we see that this is the\r\nstandard of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of\r\nNew Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one compared with another; but\r\nthey are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants\r\nand animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce\r\nabsolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with\r\nthis high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of\r\nlight is said by Muller not to be perfect even in that most perfect\r\norgan, the human eye. Helmholtz, whose judgment no one will dispute,\r\nafter describing in the strongest terms the wonderful powers of the\r\nhuman eye, adds these remarkable words: \"That which we have discovered\r\nin the way of inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and\r\nin the image on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the\r\nincongruities which we have just come across in the domain of the\r\nsensations. One might say that nature has taken delight in accumulating\r\ncontradictions in order to remove all foundation from the theory of a\r\npre-existing harmony between the external and internal worlds.\" If our\r\nreason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable\r\ncontrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily\r\nerr on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we\r\nconsider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many\r\nkinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures,\r\nand thus inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its\r\nviscera?\r\n\r\nIf we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote\r\nprogenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many\r\nmembers of the same great order, and that it has since been modified\r\nbut not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally\r\nadapted for some other object, such as to produce galls, since\r\nintensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the\r\nsting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole\r\nthe power of stinging be useful to the social community, it will fulfil\r\nall the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death\r\nof some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by\r\nwhich the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the\r\nproduction for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are\r\nutterly useless to the community for any other purpose, and which are\r\nultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may\r\nbe difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred\r\nof the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the young queens, her\r\ndaughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish herself in the combat;\r\nfor undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love\r\nor maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all\r\nthe same to the inexorable principles of natural selection. If we admire\r\nthe several ingenious contrivances by which orchids and many other\r\nplants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally\r\nperfect the elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so\r\nthat a few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: THE LAW OF UNITY OF TYPE AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE\r\nEMBRACED BY THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and\r\nobjections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are\r\nserious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on\r\nseveral facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are\r\nutterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not\r\nindefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of\r\nintermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection\r\nis always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a few forms;\r\nand partly because the very process of natural selection implies the\r\ncontinual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate\r\ngradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area,\r\nmust often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when\r\nthe conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to\r\nanother. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous\r\narea, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an\r\nintermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety\r\nwill usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it\r\nconnects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further\r\nmodification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great\r\nadvantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus\r\ngenerally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding\r\nthat the most different habits of life could not graduate into each\r\nother; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural\r\nselection from an animal which at first only glided through the air.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a species under new conditions of life may change its\r\nhabits, or it may have diversified habits, with some very unlike those\r\nof its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that\r\neach organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has\r\narisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers,\r\ndiving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been\r\nformed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in\r\nthe case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in\r\ncomplexity, each good for its possessor, then under changing conditions\r\nof life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any\r\nconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases\r\nin which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should\r\nbe extremely cautious in concluding that none can have existed, for the\r\nmetamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in function\r\nare at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been\r\nconverted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed\r\nsimultaneously very different functions, and then having been in part\r\nor in whole specialised for one function; and two distinct organs\r\nhaving performed at the same time the same function, the one having been\r\nperfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated\r\ntransitions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the\r\nnatural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external\r\nappearance closely similar may have been separately and independently\r\nformed; but when such organs are closely examined, essential differences\r\nin their structure can almost always be detected; and this naturally\r\nfollows from the principle of natural selection. On the other hand, the\r\ncommon rule throughout nature is infinite diversity of structure for\r\ngaining the same end; and this again naturally follows from the same\r\ngreat principle.\r\n\r\nIn many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that\r\na part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that\r\nmodifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated\r\nby means of natural selection. In many other cases, modifications\r\nare probably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth,\r\nindependently of any good having been thus gained. But even such\r\nstructures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken\r\nadvantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under\r\nnew conditions of life. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of\r\nhigh importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic\r\nanimal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such\r\nsmall importance that it could not, in its present state, have been\r\nacquired by means of natural selection.\r\n\r\nNatural selection can produce nothing in one species for the exclusive\r\ngood or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and\r\nexcretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious\r\nto another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the\r\npossessor. In each well-stocked country natural selection acts through\r\nthe competition of the inhabitants and consequently leads to success\r\nin the battle for life, only in accordance with the standard of that\r\nparticular country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the\r\nsmaller one, often yield to the inhabitants of another and generally the\r\nlarger country. For in the larger country there will have existed more\r\nindividuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will\r\nhave been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been\r\nrendered higher. Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute\r\nperfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can\r\nabsolute perfection be everywhere predicated.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full\r\nmeaning of that old canon in natural history, \"Natura non facit saltum.\"\r\nThis canon, if we look to the present inhabitants alone of the world, is\r\nnot strictly correct; but if we include all those of past times, whether\r\nknown or unknown, it must on this theory be strictly true.\r\n\r\nIt is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on\r\ntwo great laws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity\r\nof type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see\r\nin organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of\r\ntheir habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity\r\nof descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted\r\non by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of\r\nnatural selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the\r\nvarying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions\r\nof life; or by having adapted them during past periods of time: the\r\nadaptations being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse\r\nof parts, being affected by the direct action of external conditions\r\nof life, and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and\r\nvariation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the\r\nhigher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former variations\r\nand adaptations, that of Unity of Type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Thus a distinguished German\r\nnaturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I\r\nconsider all organic beings as imperfect: what I have really said is,\r\nthat all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their\r\nconditions; and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms\r\nin many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding\r\nforeigners. Nor can organic beings, even if they were at any one time\r\nperfectly adapted to their conditions of life, have remained so, when\r\ntheir conditions changed, unless they themselves likewise changed; and\r\nno one will dispute that the physical conditions of each country, as\r\nwell as the number and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many\r\nmutations.\r\n\r\nA critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical accuracy,\r\nthat longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that he who\r\nbelieves in natural selection \"must arrange his genealogical tree\" in\r\nsuch a manner that all the descendants have longer lives than their\r\nprogenitors! Cannot our critics conceive that a biennial plant or one of\r\nthe lower animals might range into a cold climate and perish there every\r\nwinter; and yet, owing to advantages gained through natural selection,\r\nsurvive from year to year by means of its seeds or ova? Mr. E. Ray\r\nLankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far\r\nas its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that longevity\r\nis generally related to the standard of each species in the scale of\r\norganisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction\r\nand in general activity. And these conditions have, it is probable, been\r\nlargely determined through natural selection.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt,\r\nof which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four\r\nthousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world. But, as\r\nMr. G.H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much,\r\nfor the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or\r\nembalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living;\r\nyet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through\r\nthe modification of their original types. The many animals which have\r\nremained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would\r\nhave been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed\r\nto great changes of climate and have migrated over great distances;\r\nwhereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the\r\nconditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely uniform.\r\nThe fact of little or no modification having been effected since the\r\nglacial period, would have been of some avail against those who believe\r\nin an innate and necessary law of development, but is powerless against\r\nthe doctrine of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which\r\nimplies that when variations or individual differences of a beneficial\r\nnature happen to arise, these will be preserved; but this will be\r\neffected only under certain favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German\r\ntranslation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural\r\nselection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species?\r\nIf both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life\r\nor conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side\r\npolymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar\r\nnature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism,\r\netc., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can\r\ndiscover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land,\r\ndry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of animals which wander\r\nmuch about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally\r\nconfined to distinct regions.\r\n\r\nBronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in\r\nsingle characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes\r\nthat many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the\r\nsame time through variation and natural selection? But there is no\r\nnecessity for supposing that all the parts of any being have been\r\nsimultaneously modified. The most striking modifications, excellently\r\nadapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired\r\nby successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in\r\nanother; and as they would be transmitted all together, they would\r\nappear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed. The best\r\nanswer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic\r\nraces which have been modified, chiefly through man's power of\r\nselection, for some special purpose. Look at the race and dray-horse, or\r\nat the greyhound and mastiff. Their whole frames, and even their mental\r\ncharacteristics, have been modified; but if we could trace each step\r\nin the history of their transformation--and the latter steps can be\r\ntraced--we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first\r\none part and then another slightly modified and improved. Even when\r\nselection has been applied by man to some one character alone--of which\r\nour cultivated plants offer the best instances--it will invariably be\r\nfound that although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or\r\nleaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been\r\nslightly modified. This may be attributed partly to the principle of\r\ncorrelated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation.\r\n\r\nA much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by\r\nBroca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever\r\nto their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through\r\nnatural selection. Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the\r\ndifferent species of hares and mice--the complex folds of enamel in the\r\nteeth of many animals, and a multitude of analogous cases. With respect\r\nto plants, this subject has been discussed by Nageli in an admirable\r\nessay. He admits that natural selection has effected much, but he\r\ninsists that the families of plants differ chiefly from each other in\r\nmorphological characters, which appear to be quite unimportant for the\r\nwelfare of the species. He consequently believes in an innate tendency\r\ntowards progressive and more perfect development. He specifies the\r\narrangement of the cells in the tissues, and of the leaves on the axis,\r\nas cases in which natural selection could not have acted. To these\r\nmay be added the numerical divisions in the parts of the flower, the\r\nposition of the ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use for\r\ndissemination, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is much force in the above objection. Nevertheless, we ought, in\r\nthe first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what\r\nstructures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species. In\r\nthe second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part\r\nis modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes,\r\nsuch as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual\r\npressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed,\r\nand so forth--as well as through other causes which lead to the\r\nmany mysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least\r\nunderstand. These agencies may be all grouped together, for the sake of\r\nbrevity, under the expression of the laws of growth. In the third\r\nplace, we have to allow for the direct and definite action of changed\r\nconditions of life, and for so-called spontaneous variations, in which\r\nthe nature of the conditions apparently plays a quite subordinate part.\r\nBud-variations, such as the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose,\r\nor of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good instances of spontaneous\r\nvariations; but even in these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a\r\nminute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel\r\ntoo sure that the above variations are not the effect of some local\r\nchange in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the conditions.\r\nThere must be some efficient cause for each slight individual\r\ndifference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which\r\noccasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently,\r\nit is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be\r\nsimilarly modified.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems\r\nprobable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to\r\nspontaneous variability. But it is impossible to attribute to this cause\r\nthe innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits\r\nof life of each species. I can no more believe in this than that\r\nthe well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the\r\nprinciple of selection by man was well understood, excited so much\r\nsurprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can thus be explained.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks. With\r\nrespect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is\r\nhardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known\r\nanimals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one\r\ndoubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has\r\nonly recently been, ascertained. As Bronn gives the length of the ears\r\nand tail in the several species of mice as instances, though trifling\r\nones, of differences in structure which can be of no special use, I may\r\nmention that, according to Dr. Schobl, the external ears of the common\r\nmouse are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that\r\nthey no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can\r\nhardly be quite unimportant. We shall, also, presently see that the tail\r\nis a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use\r\nwould be much influence by its length.\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I shall\r\nconfine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the\r\nflowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures,\r\nwhich a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological\r\ndifferences without any special function; but they are now known to be\r\nof the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through\r\nthe aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural\r\nselection. No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and\r\ntheir arrangement, could have been of any service, but now we know this\r\nto be the case.\r\n\r\nIn certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others\r\nthey are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one\r\novule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position. These\r\npositions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological\r\nsignification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium\r\nthe upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones\r\nalone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on\r\nthe direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium. If so, the\r\nposition of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended\r\nwithin the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight\r\ndeviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the\r\nproduction of seed.\r\n\r\nSeveral plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers\r\nof two kinds--the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed\r\nand imperfect. These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully\r\nin structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same\r\nplant. The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the\r\nbenefits which certainly are derived from this process are thus secured.\r\nThe closed and imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of high\r\nimportance, as they yield with the utmost safety a large stock of seed,\r\nwith the expenditure of wonderfully little pollen. The two kinds of\r\nflowers often differ much, as just stated, in structure. The petals in\r\nthe imperfect flowers almost always consist of mere rudiments, and the\r\npollen-grains are reduced in diameter. In Ononis columnae five of the\r\nalternate stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three\r\nstamens are in this state, two retaining their proper function, but\r\nbeing of very small size. In six out of thirty of the closed flowers in\r\nan Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never produced with\r\nme perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the normal number of\r\nfive to three. In one section of the Malpighiaceae the closed flowers,\r\naccording to A. de Jussieu, are still further modified, for the five\r\nstamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all aborted, a sixth\r\nstamen standing opposite to a petal being alone developed; and this\r\nstamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of this species; the style\r\nis aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to two. Now although\r\nnatural selection may well have had the power to prevent some of\r\nthe flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount of pollen, when\r\nrendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous, yet hardly any of\r\nthe above special modifications can have been thus determined, but\r\nmust have followed from the laws of growth, including the functional\r\ninactivity of parts, during the progress of the reduction of the pollen\r\nand the closure of the flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of\r\ngrowth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely\r\nof differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative\r\nposition on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain\r\nfir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to\r\nSchacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the\r\ncommon rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or\r\nterminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five\r\ndivisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are\r\ntetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has\r\ntwo calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding\r\nflowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs\r\npentamerous. In many Compositae and Umbelliferae (and in some other\r\nplants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more\r\ndeveloped than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with\r\nthe abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact,\r\npreviously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference\r\nand centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other\r\ncharacters. In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes\r\nalone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields\r\nachenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferae the exterior\r\nseeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one\r\ncoelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De\r\nCandolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance.\r\nProfessor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in\r\nthe lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and\r\nin the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded\r\nsiliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the\r\nwell-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers\r\nconspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can\r\njudge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All\r\nthese modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action\r\nof the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and\r\nleaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and\r\ninternal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions,\r\nall would have been modified in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are\r\nconsidered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature,\r\naffecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on\r\ndistinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions. As\r\nthese variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot\r\nhave been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite\r\nignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases,\r\nto any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only\r\na few instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers\r\nindifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc., that I need not give\r\nexamples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the\r\nparts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers\r\nof Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which\r\nis the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The\r\nmanner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a\r\nvery constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states\r\nthat with some species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as\r\nfrequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which\r\nlatter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following\r\ncases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with\r\na single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same\r\nplant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries.\r\nIn Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or\r\ntri-locular; and in H. mutabile, \"Une lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE,\r\ns'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta.\" In the flowers of Saponaria\r\nofficinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free\r\ncentral placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the southern\r\nextreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms which he did\r\nnot at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them\r\ngrowing on the same bush; and he then adds, \"Voila donc dans un meme\r\nindividu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe\r\nverticale et tantot a un gynobase.\"\r\n\r\nWe thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be\r\nattributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts,\r\nindependently of natural selection. But with respect to Nageli's\r\ndoctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive\r\ndevelopment, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced\r\nvariations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing\r\ntowards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer\r\nfrom the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying greatly\r\non the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely small\r\nimportance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they may\r\ngenerally be to us for our classifications. The acquisition of a useless\r\npart can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural scale; and\r\nin the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above described, if any\r\nnew principle has to be invoked, it must be one of retrogression rather\r\nthan of progression; and so it must be with many parasitic and degraded\r\nanimals. We are ignorant of the exciting cause of the above specified\r\nmodifications; but if the unknown cause were to act almost uniformly for\r\na length of time, we may infer that the result would be almost uniform;\r\nand in this case all the individuals of the species would be modified in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare\r\nof the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would\r\nnot have been accumulated and augmented through natural selection. A\r\nstructure which has been developed through long-continued selection,\r\nwhen it ceases to be of service to a species, generally becomes\r\nvariable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be\r\nregulated by this same power of selection. But when, from the nature\r\nof the organism and of the conditions, modifications have been induced\r\nwhich are unimportant for the welfare of the species, they may be, and\r\napparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the same state to\r\nnumerous, otherwise modified, descendants. It cannot have been of much\r\nimportance to the greater number of mammals, birds, or reptiles, whether\r\nthey were clothed with hair, feathers or scales; yet hair has been\r\ntransmitted to almost all mammals, feathers to all birds, and scales to\r\nall true reptiles. A structure, whatever it may be, which is common to\r\nmany allied forms, is ranked by us as of high systematic importance,\r\nand consequently is often assumed to be of high vital importance to the\r\nspecies. Thus, as I am inclined to believe, morphological differences,\r\nwhich we consider as important--such as the arrangement of the leaves,\r\nthe divisions of the flower or of the ovarium, the position of the\r\novules, etc., first appeared in many cases as fluctuating variations,\r\nwhich sooner or later became constant through the nature of the organism\r\nand of the surrounding conditions, as well as through the intercrossing\r\nof distinct individuals, but not through natural selection; for as these\r\nmorphological characters do not affect the welfare of the species, any\r\nslight deviations in them could not have been governed or accumulated\r\nthrough this latter agency. It is a strange result which we thus arrive\r\nat, namely, that characters of slight vital importance to the species,\r\nare the most important to the systematist; but, as we shall hereafter\r\nsee when we treat of the genetic principle of classification, this is by\r\nno means so paradoxical as it may at first appear.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of\r\nan innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessarily\r\nfollows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through the\r\ncontinued action of natural selection. For the best definition which\r\nhas ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree\r\nto which the parts have been specialised or differentiated; and natural\r\nselection tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled\r\nto perform their functions more efficiently.\r\n\r\nA distinguished zoologist, Mr. St. George Mivart, has recently collected\r\nall the objections which have ever been advanced by myself and others\r\nagainst the theory of natural selection, as propounded by Mr. Wallace\r\nand myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art and force. When\r\nthus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no\r\npart of Mr. Mivart's plan to give the various facts and considerations\r\nopposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is\r\nleft to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides.\r\nWhen discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the effects of the\r\nincreased use and disuse of parts, which I have always maintained to be\r\nhighly important, and have treated in my \"Variation under Domestication\"\r\nat greater length than, as I believe, any other writer. He likewise\r\noften assumes that I attribute nothing to variation, independently of\r\nnatural selection, whereas in the work just referred to I have collected\r\na greater number of well-established cases than can be found in any\r\nother work known to me. My judgment may not be trustworthy, but after\r\nreading with care Mr. Mivart's book, and comparing each section with\r\nwhat I have said on the same head, I never before felt so strongly\r\nconvinced of the general truth of the conclusions here arrived at,\r\nsubject, of course, in so intricate a subject, to much partial error.\r\n\r\nAll Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in the\r\npresent volume. The one new point which appears to have struck many\r\nreaders is, \"That natural selection is incompetent to account for the\r\nincipient stages of useful structures.\" This subject is intimately\r\nconnected with that of the gradation of the characters, often\r\naccompanied by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a\r\nswim-bladder into lungs, points which were discussed in the last chapter\r\nunder two headings. Nevertheless, I will here consider in some detail\r\nseveral of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those which are\r\nthe most illustrative, as want of space prevents me from considering\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head\r\nand tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the\r\nhigher branches of trees. It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of\r\nthe other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and\r\nthis must be a great advantage to it during dearths. The Niata cattle\r\nin South America show us how small a difference in structure may make,\r\nduring such periods, a great difference in preserving an animal's\r\nlife. These cattle can browse as well as others on grass, but from the\r\nprojection of the lower jaw they cannot, during the often recurrent\r\ndroughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds, etc., to which food the\r\ncommon cattle and horses are then driven; so that at these times the\r\nNiatas perish, if not fed by their owners. Before coming to Mr. Mivart's\r\nobjections, it may be well to explain once again how natural selection\r\nwill act in all ordinary cases. Man has modified some of his animals,\r\nwithout necessarily having attended to special points of structure, by\r\nsimply preserving and breeding from the fleetest individuals, as with\r\nthe race-horse and greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding\r\nfrom the victorious birds. So under nature with the nascent giraffe, the\r\nindividuals which were the highest browsers and were able during dearths\r\nto reach even an inch or two above the others, will often have been\r\npreserved; for they will have roamed over the whole country in search of\r\nfood. That the individuals of the same species often differ slightly\r\nin the relative lengths of all their parts may be seen in many works of\r\nnatural history, in which careful measurements are given. These slight\r\nproportional differences, due to the laws of growth and variation, are\r\nnot of the slightest use or importance to most species. But it will have\r\nbeen otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits\r\nof life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts\r\nof their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally\r\nhave survived. These will have intercrossed and left offspring, either\r\ninheriting the same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary\r\nagain in the same manner; while the individuals less favoured in the\r\nsame respects will have been the most liable to perish.\r\n\r\nWe here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man does,\r\nwhen he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will preserve\r\nand thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them freely\r\nto intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals. By this\r\nprocess long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have\r\ncalled unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most\r\nimportant manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of\r\nparts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped\r\nmight be converted into a giraffe.\r\n\r\nTo this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections. One is\r\nthat the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased\r\nsupply of food, and he considers it as \"very problematical whether the\r\ndisadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than\r\ncounterbalance the advantages.\" But as the giraffe does actually exist\r\nin large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the\r\nworld, taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as\r\nfar as size is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have\r\nexisted there, subjected as now to severe dearths. Assuredly the being\r\nable to reach, at each stage of increased size, to a supply of food,\r\nleft untouched by the other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have\r\nbeen of some advantage to the nascent giraffe. Nor must we overlook the\r\nfact, that increased bulk would act as a protection against almost all\r\nbeasts of prey excepting the lion; and against this animal, its tall\r\nneck--and the taller the better--would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has\r\nremarked, serve as a watch-tower. It is from this cause, as Sir S. Baker\r\nremarks, that no animal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe.\r\nThis animal also uses its long neck as a means of offence or defence,\r\nby violently swinging its head armed with stump-like horns. The\r\npreservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one\r\nadvantage, but by the union of all, great and small.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural\r\nselection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage,\r\nwhy has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty\r\nstature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel,\r\nguanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of the\r\ngroup acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which was\r\nformerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not\r\ndifficult, and can best be given by an illustration. In every meadow\r\nin England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or\r\nplaned to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle; and\r\nwhat advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to\r\nacquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one kind of animal\r\nwill almost certainly be able to browse higher than the others; and it\r\nis almost equally certain that this one kind alone could have its neck\r\nelongated for this purpose, through natural selection and the effects\r\nof increased use. In South Africa the competition for browsing on the\r\nhigher branches of the acacias and other trees must be between giraffe\r\nand giraffe, and not with the other ungulate animals.\r\n\r\nWhy, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this\r\nsame order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis,\r\ncannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a\r\ndistinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of\r\nmankind did not occur in one country while it did in another. We are\r\nignorant with respect to the conditions which determine the numbers and\r\nrange of each species, and we cannot even conjecture what changes of\r\nstructure would be favourable to its increase in some new country. We\r\ncan, however, see in a general manner that various causes might have\r\ninterfered with the development of a long neck or proboscis. To reach\r\nthe foliage at a considerable height (without climbing, for which hoofed\r\nanimals are singularly ill-constructed) implies greatly increased\r\nbulk of body; and we know that some areas support singularly few large\r\nquadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is so luxuriant,\r\nwhile South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled degree. Why this\r\nshould be so we do not know; nor why the later tertiary periods should\r\nhave been much more favourable for their existence than the present\r\ntime. Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain\r\ndistricts and times would have been much more favourable than others for\r\nthe development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.\r\n\r\nIn order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and\r\nlargely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts\r\nshould be modified and coadapted. Although every part of the body varies\r\nslightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts should always\r\nvary in the right direction and to the right degree. With the different\r\nspecies of our domesticated animals we know that the parts vary in\r\na different manner and degree, and that some species are much more\r\nvariable than others. Even if the fitting variations did arise, it\r\ndoes not follow that natural selection would be able to act on them and\r\nproduce a structure which apparently would be beneficial to the species.\r\nFor instance, if the number of individuals existing in a country is\r\ndetermined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey--by external\r\nor internal parasites, etc.--as seems often to be the case, then natural\r\nselection will be able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in\r\nmodifying any particular structure for obtaining food. Lastly, natural\r\nselection is a slow process, and the same favourable conditions must\r\nlong endure in order that any marked effect should thus be produced.\r\nExcept by assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot explain\r\nwhy, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired\r\nmuch elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\nObjections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by\r\nmany writers. In each case various causes, besides the general ones just\r\nindicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through natural\r\nselection of structures, which it is thought would be beneficial to\r\ncertain species. One writer asks, why has not the ostrich acquired the\r\npower of flight? But a moment's reflection will show what an enormous\r\nsupply of food would be necessary to give to this bird of the desert\r\nforce to move its huge body through the air. Oceanic islands are\r\ninhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as some\r\nof these bats are peculiar species, they must have long inhabited their\r\npresent homes. Therefore Sir C. Lyell asks, and assigns certain reasons\r\nin answer, why have not seals and bats given birth on such islands to\r\nforms fitted to live on the land? But seals would necessarily be first\r\nconverted into terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and\r\nbats into terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would\r\nbe no prey; for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these\r\nwould already be largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first\r\ncolonise and abound on most oceanic islands. Gradations of structure,\r\nwith each stage beneficial to a changing species, will be favoured only\r\nunder certain peculiar conditions. A strictly terrestrial animal, by\r\noccasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or\r\nlakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic\r\nas to brave the open ocean. But seals would not find on oceanic\r\nislands the conditions favourable to their gradual reconversion into a\r\nterrestrial form. Bats, as formerly shown, probably acquired their\r\nwings by at first gliding through the air from tree to tree, like the\r\nso-called flying squirrels, for the sake of escaping from their enemies,\r\nor for avoiding falls; but when the power of true flight had once been\r\nacquired, it would never be reconverted back, at least for the above\r\npurposes, into the less efficient power of gliding through the air.\r\nBats, might, indeed, like many birds, have had their wings greatly\r\nreduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse; but in this case\r\nit would be necessary that they should first have acquired the power of\r\nrunning quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind legs alone, so\r\nas to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such a change\r\na bat seems singularly ill-fitted. These conjectural remarks have been\r\nmade merely to show that a transition of structure, with each step\r\nbeneficial, is a highly complex affair; and that there is nothing\r\nstrange in a transition not having occurred in any particular case.\r\n\r\nLastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their\r\nmental powers more highly developed than others, as such development\r\nwould be advantageous to all? Why have not apes acquired the\r\nintellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned; but as\r\nthey are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot be weighed,\r\nit would be useless to give them. A definite answer to the latter\r\nquestion ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve the\r\nsimpler problem, why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher in\r\nthe scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently implies\r\nincreased brain power.\r\n\r\nWe will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections. Insects often resemble\r\nfor the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed\r\nleaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of birds,\r\nand living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter recur.\r\nThe resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined to\r\ncolour, but extends to form, and even to the manner in which the insects\r\nhold themselves. The caterpillars which project motionless like dead\r\ntwigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent instance of\r\na resemblance of this kind. The cases of the imitation of such objects\r\nas the excrement of birds, are rare and exceptional. On this head,\r\nMr. Mivart remarks, \"As, according to Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a\r\nconstant tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient\r\nvariations will be in ALL DIRECTIONS, they must tend to neutralize\r\neach other, and at first to form such unstable modifications that it is\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to see how such indefinite oscillations\r\nof infinitesimal beginnings can ever build up a sufficiently appreciable\r\nresemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other object, for natural selection to\r\nseize upon and perpetuate.\"\r\n\r\nBut in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state\r\nno doubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object\r\ncommonly found in the stations frequented by them. Nor is this at\r\nall improbable, considering the almost infinite number of surrounding\r\nobjects and the diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects\r\nwhich exist. As some rude resemblance is necessary for the first start,\r\nwe can understand how it is that the larger and higher animals do not\r\n(with the exception, as far as I know, of one fish) resemble for the\r\nsake of protection special objects, but only the surface which commonly\r\nsurrounds them, and this chiefly in colour. Assuming that an insect\r\noriginally happened to resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed\r\nleaf, and that it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations\r\nwhich rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus\r\nfavoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations would\r\nbe neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they rendered the insect at\r\nall less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated. There would\r\nindeed be force in Mr. Mivart's objection, if we were to attempt to\r\naccount for the above resemblances, independently of natural selection,\r\nthrough mere fluctuating variability; but as the case stands there is\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nNor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart's difficulty with respect to \"the\r\nlast touches of perfection in the mimicry;\" as in the case given by\r\nMr. Wallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus), which\r\nresembles \"a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia.\"\r\nSo close was this resemblance, that a native Dyak maintained that the\r\nfoliaceous excrescences were really moss. Insects are preyed on by birds\r\nand other enemies whose sight is probably sharper than ours, and\r\nevery grade in resemblance which aided an insect to escape notice or\r\ndetection, would tend towards its preservation; and the more perfect the\r\nresemblance so much the better for the insect. Considering the nature\r\nof the differences between the species in the group which includes\r\nthe above Ceroxylus, there is nothing improbable in this insect having\r\nvaried in the irregularities on its surface, and in these having become\r\nmore or less green-coloured; for in every group the characters which\r\ndiffer in the several species are the most apt to vary, while the\r\ngeneric characters, or those common to all the species, are the most\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the world,\r\nand the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities. The\r\nbaleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about 300\r\nplates or laminae, which stand close together transversely to the longer\r\naxis of the mouth. Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows.\r\nThe extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into\r\nstiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to\r\nstrain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which\r\nthese great animals subsist. The middle and longest lamina in the\r\nGreenland whale is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in\r\nthe different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the\r\nmiddle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet,\r\nin another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera\r\nrostrata only about nine inches in length. The quality of the whalebone\r\nalso differs in the different species.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it \"had once\r\nattained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then\r\nits preservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be\r\npromoted by natural selection alone. But how to obtain the beginning of\r\nsuch useful development?\" In answer, it may be asked, why should not\r\nthe early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth\r\nconstructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks,\r\nlike whales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family has\r\nsometimes been called Criblatores, or sifters. I hope that I may not\r\nbe misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did actually\r\npossess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck. I wish only to show\r\nthat this is not incredible, and that the immense plates of baleen in\r\nthe Greenland whale might have been developed from such lamellae by\r\nfinely graduated steps, each of service to its possessor.\r\n\r\nThe beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful\r\nand complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is\r\nfurnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or\r\ncomb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to\r\nbe pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.\r\nThey arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to\r\nthe sides of the mandible. Those standing towards the middle are the\r\nlongest, being about one-third of an inch in length, and they project\r\nfourteen one-hundredths of an inch beneath the edge. At their bases\r\nthere is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellae. In\r\nthese several respects they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth\r\nof a whale. But towards the extremity of the beak they differ much, as\r\nthey project inward, instead of straight downward. The entire head of\r\nthe shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth\r\nof the length of the head of a moderately large Balaenoptera rostrata,\r\nin which species the baleen is only nine inches long; so that if we were\r\nto make the head of the shoveller as long as that of the Balaenoptera,\r\nthe lamellae would be six inches in length, that is, two-thirds of the\r\nlength of the baleen in this species of whale. The lower mandible of\r\nthe shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellae of equal length with these\r\nabove, but finer; and in being thus furnished it differs conspicuously\r\nfrom the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute of baleen. On the\r\nother hand, the extremities of these lower lamellae are frayed into\r\nfine bristly points, so that they thus curiously resemble the plates\r\nof baleen. In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of the\r\nPetrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellae, which are\r\nwell developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this\r\nbird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.\r\n\r\nFrom the highly developed structure of the shoveller's beak we may\r\nproceed (as I have learned from information and specimens sent to me by\r\nMr. Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting\r\nis concerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some\r\nrespects through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common\r\nduck. In this latter species the lamellae are much coarser than in the\r\nshoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they\r\nare only about fifty in number on each side, and do not project at\r\nall beneath the margin. They are square-topped, and are edged with\r\ntranslucent, hardish tissue, as if for crushing food. The edges of the\r\nlower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which project very\r\nlittle. Although the beak is thus very inferior as a sifter to that of\r\na shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows, constantly uses it for\r\nthis purpose. There are other species, as I hear from Mr. Salvin, in\r\nwhich the lamellae are considerably less developed than in the common\r\nduck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for sifting the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTurning to another group of the same family. In the Egyptian goose\r\n(Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but the\r\nlamellae are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor do\r\nthey project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr. E.\r\nBartlett, \"uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at the\r\ncorners.\" Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like the\r\ncommon goose. In this latter bird the lamellae of the upper mandible\r\nare much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about\r\ntwenty-seven in number on each side, and terminating upward in\r\nteeth-like knobs. The palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs.\r\nThe edges of the lower mandible are serrated with teeth much more\r\nprominent, coarser and sharper than in the duck. The common goose does\r\nnot sift the water, but uses its beak exclusively for tearing or cutting\r\nherbage, for which purpose it is so well fitted that it can crop grass\r\ncloser than almost any other animal. There are other species of geese,\r\nas I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the lamellae are less developed\r\nthan in the common goose.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed\r\nlike that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even\r\na member with a beak having less well-developed lamellae, might be\r\nconverted by small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose--this\r\ninto one like the common duck--and, lastly, into one like the shoveller,\r\nprovided with a beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water;\r\nfor this bird could hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked\r\ntip, for seizing or tearing solid food. The beak of a goose, as I may\r\nadd, might also be converted by small changes into one provided with\r\nprominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the\r\nsame family), serving for the widely different purpose of securing live\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nReturning to the whales. The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true\r\nteeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according\r\nto Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn. There is,\r\ntherefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean form\r\nwas provided with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather more\r\nregularly placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the goose,\r\naided it in seizing or tearing its food. If so, it will hardly be denied\r\nthat the points might have been converted through variation and natural\r\nselection into lamellae as well-developed as those of the Egyptian\r\ngoose, in which case they would have been used both for seizing objects\r\nand for sifting the water; then into lamellae like those of the domestic\r\nduck; and so onward, until they became as well constructed as those of\r\nthe shoveller, in which case they would have served exclusively as\r\na sifting apparatus. From this stage, in which the lamellae would be\r\ntwo-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen in the Balaenoptera\r\nrostrata, gradations, which may be observed in still-existing Cetaceans,\r\nlead us onward to the enormous plates of baleen in the Greenland whale.\r\nNor is there the least reason to doubt that each step in this scale\r\nmight have been as serviceable to certain ancient Cetaceans, with\r\nthe functions of the parts slowly changing during the progress of\r\ndevelopment, as are the gradations in the beaks of the different\r\nexisting members of the duck-family. We should bear in mind that each\r\nspecies of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and\r\nthat the structure of every part of its frame must be well adapted to\r\nits conditions of life.\r\n\r\nThe Pleuronectidae, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical\r\nbodies. They rest on one side--in the greater number of species on the\r\nleft, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult\r\nspecimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight\r\nthe ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less\r\ndeveloped in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often\r\nof smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for\r\nthey are both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth,\r\nhowever, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then\r\nsymmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper to\r\nthe lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side;\r\nbut does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly thought to be\r\nthe case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round,\r\nit could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on\r\none side. The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by\r\nthe sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by\r\ntheir flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life,\r\nis manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc., being\r\nextremely common. The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection\r\nfrom their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground. The\r\ndifferent members, however, of the family present, as Schiodte\r\nremarks, \"a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from\r\nHippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter\r\nthe shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely\r\nthrown to one side.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden spontaneous\r\ntransformation in the position of the eyes is hardly conceivable, in\r\nwhich I quite agree with him. He then adds: \"If the transit was gradual,\r\nthen how such transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey\r\ntowards the other side of the head could benefit the individual\r\nis, indeed, far from clear. It seems, even, that such an incipient\r\ntransformation must rather have been injurious.\" But he might have found\r\nan answer to this objection in the excellent observations published\r\nin 1867 by Malm. The Pleuronectidae, while very young and still\r\nsymmetrical, with their eyes standing on opposite sides of the head,\r\ncannot long retain a vertical position, owing to the excessive depth of\r\ntheir bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and to their being\r\ndestitute of a swim-bladder. Hence, soon growing tired, they fall to\r\nthe bottom on one side. While thus at rest they often twist, as Malm\r\nobserved, the lower eye upward, to see above them; and they do this so\r\nvigorously that the eye is pressed hard against the upper part of the\r\norbit. The forehead between the eyes consequently becomes, as could be\r\nplainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth. On one occasion Malm\r\nsaw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye through an angular\r\ndistance of about seventy degrees.\r\n\r\nWe should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous and\r\nflexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action. It is also known\r\nwith the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull\r\nyields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently\r\ncontracted through disease or some accident. With long-eared rabbits,\r\nif one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the\r\nbones of the skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure.\r\nMalm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several\r\nother symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on\r\none side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often then\r\nstrain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are thus\r\nrendered rather crooked. These fishes, however, are soon able to hold\r\nthemselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is thus\r\nproduced. With the Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they\r\ngrow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing\r\nflatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the\r\nform of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy,\r\nthe tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the\r\nprinciple of inheritance. Schiodte believes, in opposition to some other\r\nnaturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical even\r\nin the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is that\r\ncertain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the left\r\nside, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in confirmation\r\nof the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is not a\r\nmember of the Pleuronectidae, rests on its left side at the bottom, and\r\nswims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two sides\r\nof the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar. Our great authority\r\non Fishes, Dr. Gunther, concludes his abstract of Malm's paper, by\r\nremarking that \"the author gives a very simple explanation of the\r\nabnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids.\"\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one\r\nside of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be\r\ninjurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the\r\nindividual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both\r\neyes, while resting on one side at the bottom. We may also attribute to\r\nthe inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds\r\nof flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones\r\nstronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than\r\non the other, for the sake, as Dr. Traquair supposes, of feeding with\r\nease on the ground. Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less\r\ndeveloped condition of the whole inferior half of the body, including\r\nthe lateral fins; though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these\r\nfins is advantageous to the fish, as \"there is so much less room for\r\ntheir action than with the larger fins above.\" Perhaps the lesser number\r\nof teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the\r\ntwo jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves,\r\nmay likewise be accounted for by disuse. From the colourless state of\r\nthe ventral surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may\r\nreasonably suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side,\r\nwhether it be the right or left, which is under-most, is due to the\r\nexclusion of light. But it cannot be supposed that the peculiar speckled\r\nappearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the sandy bed of the\r\nsea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by Pouchet, of\r\nchanging their colour in accordance with the surrounding surface, or the\r\npresence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot, are due to\r\nthe action of the light. Here natural selection has probably come into\r\nplay, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body of these\r\nfishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of life. We should\r\nkeep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the inherited effects\r\nof the increased use of parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be\r\nstrengthened by natural selection. For all spontaneous variations in the\r\nright direction will thus be preserved; as will those individuals\r\nwhich inherit in the highest degree the effects of the increased and\r\nbeneficial use of any part. How much to attribute in each particular\r\ncase to the effects of use, and how much to natural selection, it seems\r\nimpossible to decide.\r\n\r\nI may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its\r\norigin exclusively to use or habit. The extremity of the tail in\r\nsome American monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect\r\nprehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand. A reviewer, who agrees\r\nwith Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: \"It is\r\nimpossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight\r\nincipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the individuals\r\npossessing it, or favour their chance of having and of rearing\r\noffspring.\" But there is no necessity for any such belief. Habit, and\r\nthis almost implies that some benefit great or small is thus derived,\r\nwould in all probability suffice for the work. Brehm saw the young of\r\nan African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under surface of their\r\nmother by their hands, and at the same time they hooked their little\r\ntails round that of their mother. Professor Henslow kept in confinement\r\nsome harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess a structurally\r\nprehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they curled their\r\ntails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus aided\r\nthemselves in climbing. I have received an analogous account from Dr.\r\nGunther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself. If the harvest mouse\r\nhad been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail\r\nrendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some members of\r\nthe same order. Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits while young,\r\nhas not become thus provided, it would be difficult to say. It is,\r\nhowever, possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more\r\nservice to it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than\r\nas a prehensile organ.\r\n\r\nThe mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are\r\nindispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been\r\ndeveloped at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing\r\npositively about their manner of development. Mr. Mivart asks: \"Is it\r\nconceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction\r\nby accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an\r\naccidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even\r\nif one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a\r\nvariation?\" But the case is not here put fairly. It is admitted by most\r\nevolutionists that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and\r\nif so, the mammary glands will have been at first developed within\r\nthe marsupial sack. In the case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are\r\nhatched, and the young are reared for a time, within a sack of this\r\nnature; and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he\r\nhas seen of the development of the young, that they are nourished by\r\na secretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Now, with the\r\nearly progenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus\r\ndesignated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been\r\nsimilarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which secreted a\r\nfluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so as to partake of\r\nthe nature of milk, would in the long run have reared a larger number\r\nof well-nourished offspring, than would the individuals which secreted a\r\npoorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands, which are the homologues of\r\nthe mammary glands, would have been improved or rendered more effective.\r\nIt accords with the widely extended principle of specialisation, that\r\nthe glands over a certain space of the sack should have become more\r\nhighly developed than the remainder; and they would then have formed a\r\nbreast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in the Ornithorhyncus,\r\nat the base of the mammalian series. Through what agency the glands over\r\na certain space became more highly specialised than the others, I will\r\nnot pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation of growth,\r\nthe effects of use, or of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe development of the mammary glands would have been of no service, and\r\ncould not have been affected through natural selection, unless the young\r\nat the same time were able to partake of the secretion. There is no\r\ngreater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have instinctively\r\nlearned to suck the breast, than in understanding how unhatched chickens\r\nhave learned to break the egg-shell by tapping against it with their\r\nspecially adapted beaks; or how a few hours after leaving the shell they\r\nhave learned to pick up grains of food. In such cases the most probable\r\nsolution seems to be, that the habit was at first acquired by practice\r\nat a more advanced age, and afterwards transmitted to the offspring\r\nat an earlier age. But the young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to\r\ncling to the nipple of its mother, who has the power of injecting milk\r\ninto the mouth of her helpless, half-formed offspring. On this head\r\nMr. Mivart remarks: \"Did no special provision exist, the young one must\r\ninfallibly be choked by the intrusion of the milk into the wind-pipe.\r\nBut there IS a special provision. The larynx is so elongated that\r\nit rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage, and is thus\r\nenabled to give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while the milk\r\npasses harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so safely\r\nattains the gullet behind it.\" Mr. Mivart then asks how did natural\r\nselection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other mammals, on\r\nthe assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form), \"this at\r\nleast perfectly innocent and harmless structure?\" It may be suggested\r\nin answer that the voice, which is certainly of high importance to many\r\nanimals, could hardly have been used with full force as long as the\r\nlarynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor Flower has suggested\r\nto me that this structure would have greatly interfered with an animal\r\nswallowing solid food.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the\r\nanimal kingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.) are\r\nfurnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist,\r\nwhen well developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of\r\nthree serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of\r\na flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can seize firmly hold\r\nof any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or sea-urchin\r\nrapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down\r\ncertain lines of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled.\r\nBut there is no doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they\r\nsubserve other functions; and one of these apparently is defence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous\r\noccasions, asks: \"What would be the utility of the FIRST RUDIMENTARY\r\nBEGINNINGS of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings\r\nhave ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?\" He adds, \"not even\r\nthe SUDDEN development of the snapping action would have been beneficial\r\nwithout the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have been\r\nefficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite\r\nvariations could simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of\r\nstructure; to deny this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling\r\nparadox.\" Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr. Mivart, tridactyle\r\nforcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable of a snapping\r\naction, certainly exist on some star-fishes; and this is intelligible\r\nif they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence. Mr. Agassiz, to\r\nwhose great kindness I am indebted for much information on the subject,\r\ninforms me that there are other star-fishes, in which one of the three\r\narms of the forceps is reduced to a support for the other two; and\r\nagain, other genera in which the third arm is completely lost. In\r\nEchinoneus, the shell is described by M. Perrier as bearing two kinds of\r\npedicellariae, one resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of\r\nSpatangus; and such cases are always interesting as affording the means\r\nof apparently sudden transitions, through the abortion of one of the two\r\nstates of an organ.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been\r\nevolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr.\r\nMuller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae must\r\nundoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred from\r\ntheir manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long\r\nand perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from\r\nsimple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariae.\r\nThe gradation extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines\r\nand the pedicellariae, with their supporting calcareous rods, are\r\narticulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes, \"the very\r\ncombinations needed to show that the pedicellariae are only modified\r\nbranching spines\" may be found. Thus we have fixed spines, with three\r\nequi-distant, serrated, movable branches, articulated to near their\r\nbases; and higher up, on the same spine, three other movable branches.\r\nNow when the latter arise from the summit of a spine they form, in fact,\r\na rude tridactyle pedicellariae, and such may be seen on the same spine\r\ntogether with the three lower branches. In this case the identity in\r\nnature between the arms of the pedicellariae and the movable branches\r\nof a spine, is unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary\r\nspines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt\r\nthat those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise serve\r\nfor the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively\r\nas soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or snapping\r\napparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine to a fixed\r\npedicellariae, would be of service.\r\n\r\nIn certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed\r\nor borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a flexible\r\nand muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they probably\r\nsubserve some additional function besides defence. In the sea-urchins\r\nthe steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to\r\nthe shell, and is thus rendered movable. I wish I had space here to\r\ngive a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz's interesting observations on the\r\ndevelopment of the pedicellariae. All possible gradations, as he adds,\r\nmay likewise be found between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and\r\nthe hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and\r\nagain between the pedicellariae of sea-urchins and the anchors of the\r\nHolothuriae, also belonging to the same great class.\r\n\r\nCertain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namely\r\nthe Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia. These\r\ndiffer much in structure in the different species. In their most perfect\r\ncondition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a vulture in\r\nminiature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is likewise the\r\nlower jaw or mandible. In one species observed by me, all the avicularia\r\non the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards,\r\nwith the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about 90 degrees,\r\nin the course of five seconds; and their movement caused the whole\r\npolyzoary to tremble. When the jaws are touched with a needle they seize\r\nit so firmly that the branch can thus be shaken.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed\r\ndifficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the\r\npedicellariae of the Echinodermata, which he considers as \"essentially\r\nsimilar,\" having been developed through natural selection in widely\r\ndistinct divisions of the animal kingdom. But, as far as structure is\r\nconcerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae and\r\navicularia. The latter resembles somewhat more closely the chelae or\r\npincers of Crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal\r\nappropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty, or even their\r\nresemblance to the head and beak of a bird. The avicularia are believed\r\nby Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt and Dr. Nitsche--naturalists who have carefully\r\nstudied this group--to be homologous with the zooids and their\r\ncells which compose the zoophyte, the movable lip or lid of the cell\r\ncorresponding with the lower and movable mandible of the avicularium.\r\nMr. Busk, however, does not know of any gradations now existing between\r\na zooid and an avicularium. It is therefore impossible to conjecture by\r\nwhat serviceable gradations the one could have been converted into the\r\nother, but it by no means follows from this that such gradations have\r\nnot existed.\r\n\r\nAs the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of\r\nPolyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that\r\nwith the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists. In\r\nthe first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down\r\neither on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against\r\none whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the\r\nlimb still serves as an organ of locomotion. We next find one corner of\r\nthe broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished\r\nwith irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down.\r\nBy an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well\r\nas that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the\r\npincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last\r\nan instrument as efficient as the chelae of a lobster. And all these\r\ngradations can be actually traced.\r\n\r\nBesides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called\r\nvibracula. These generally consist of long bristles, capable of movement\r\nand easily excited. In one species examined by me the vibracula were\r\nslightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on\r\nthe same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that, acting like\r\nlong oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my\r\nmicroscope. When a branch was placed on its face, the vibracula became\r\nentangled, and they made violent efforts to free themselves. They are\r\nsupposed to serve as a defence, and may be seen, as Mr. Busk remarks,\r\n\"to sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of the polyzoary,\r\nremoving what might be noxious to the delicate inhabitants of the cells\r\nwhen their tentacula are protruded.\" The avicularia, like the vibracula,\r\nprobably serve for defence, but they also catch and kill small living\r\nanimals, which, it is believed, are afterwards swept by the currents\r\nwithin reach of the tentacula of the zooids. Some species are provided\r\nwith avicularia and vibracula, some with avicularia alone and a few with\r\nvibracula alone.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in\r\nappearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the\r\nhead of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been\r\ndeveloped from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.\r\nHence, we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some\r\ncases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other. Thus, with the\r\navicularia of several species of Lepralia, the movable mandible is so\r\nmuch produced and is so like a bristle that the presence of the upper\r\nor fixed beak alone serves to determine its avicularian nature. The\r\nvibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells,\r\nwithout having passed through the avicularian stage; but it seems more\r\nprobable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early\r\nstages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the\r\nincluded zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once. In many cases the\r\nvibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to represent\r\nthe fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite absent.\r\nThis view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is\r\ninteresting; for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia\r\nhad become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever\r\nhave thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an\r\norgan, resembling a bird's head, or an irregular box or hood. It is\r\ninteresting to see two such widely different organs developed from a\r\ncommon origin; and as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection\r\nto the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the\r\ngradations, by which the lip became converted first into the lower\r\nmandible of an avicularium, and then into an elongated bristle,\r\nlikewise served as a protection in different ways and under different\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely\r\nthe structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing\r\nplants. With respect to the former, he says: \"The explanation of their\r\nORIGIN is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory--utterly insufficient to\r\nexplain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are\r\nof utility only when they are considerably developed.\" As I have fully\r\ntreated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few\r\ndetails on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers\r\nof orchids, namely, their pollinia. A pollinium, when highly developed,\r\nconsists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk\r\nor caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter. The\r\npollinia are by this means transported by insects from one flower to\r\nthe stigma of another. In some orchids there is no caudicle to the\r\npollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads;\r\nbut as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be\r\nconsidered; yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous\r\nseries, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably\r\nfirst developed. In other orchids the threads cohere at one end of the\r\npollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a caudicle.\r\nThat this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of considerable\r\nlength and highly developed, we have good evidence in the aborted\r\npollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the\r\ncentral and solid parts.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass\r\nof viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of\r\ngradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In most\r\nflowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little viscid\r\nmatter. Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but\r\nin much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas; and this\r\nstigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered\r\nsterile. When an insect visits a flower of this kind, it rubs off some\r\nof the viscid matter, and thus at the same time drags away some of the\r\npollen-grains. From this simple condition, which differs but\r\nlittle from that of a multitude of common flowers, there are endless\r\ngradations--to species in which the pollen-mass terminates in a very\r\nshort, free caudicle--to others in which the caudicle becomes firmly\r\nattached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself much\r\nmodified. In this latter case we have a pollinium in its most highly\r\ndeveloped and perfect condition. He who will carefully examine the\r\nflowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the above\r\nseries of gradations--from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied together\r\nby threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of the\r\nordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted for\r\ntransportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the gradations in\r\nthe several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general\r\nstructure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects. In\r\nthis, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further\r\nbackwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower\r\nbecome viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one\r\ngroup of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt\r\nanswering, such questions.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to climbing plants. These can be arranged in a long\r\nseries, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I\r\nhave called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils. In these\r\ntwo latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the\r\npower of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the\r\ntendrils likewise possess. The gradations from leaf-climbers to tendril\r\nbearers are wonderfully close, and certain plants may be differently\r\nplaced in either class. But in ascending the series from simple twiners\r\nto leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness\r\nto a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or\r\nthese modified and converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round\r\nand clasp the touching object. He who will read my memoir on these\r\nplants will, I think, admit that all the many gradations in function and\r\nstructure between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case\r\nbeneficial in a high degree to the species. For instance, it is clearly\r\na great advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is\r\nprobable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long foot-stalks\r\nwould have been developed into a leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had\r\npossessed in any slight degree the requisite sensitiveness to a touch.\r\n\r\nAs twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the\r\nbasis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire\r\nthis power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and\r\nincreased through natural selection. The power of twining depends,\r\nfirstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible (but this\r\nis a character common to many plants which are not climbers); and,\r\nsecondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass, one\r\nafter the other in succession, in the same order. By this movement the\r\nstems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move round and round.\r\nAs soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against any object and is\r\nstopped, the upper part still goes on bending and revolving, and thus\r\nnecessarily twines round and up the support. The revolving movement\r\nceases after the early growth of each shoot. As in many widely separated\r\nfamilies of plants, single species and single genera possess the power\r\nof revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have independently\r\nacquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common progenitor.\r\nHence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a movement of\r\nthis kind would be found to be far from uncommon with plants which did\r\nnot climb; and that this had afforded the basis for natural selection\r\nto work on and improve. When I made this prediction, I knew of only one\r\nimperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia\r\nwhich revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining\r\nplants, but without making any use of this habit. Soon afterwards\r\nFritz Muller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a\r\nLinum--plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural\r\nsystem--revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has\r\nreason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants. These slight\r\nmovements appear to be of no service to the plants in question; anyhow,\r\nthey are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is the point\r\nthat concerns us. Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these\r\nplants had been flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are\r\nexposed it had profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit\r\nof slightly and irregularly revolving might have been increased and\r\nutilised through natural selection, until they had become converted into\r\nwell-developed twining species.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and\r\nflowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in\r\nthe case of the revolving movements of twining plants. As a vast number\r\nof species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this\r\nkind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in\r\nmany plants which have not become climbers. This is the case: I observed\r\nthat the young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved themselves\r\na little towards the side which was touched. Morren found in several\r\nspecies of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved,\r\nespecially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and\r\nrepeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken. I repeated these\r\nobservations on some other species of Oxalis with the same result; in\r\nsome of them the movement was distinct, but was best seen in the young\r\nleaves; in others it was extremely slight. It is a more important fact\r\nthat according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and\r\nleaves of all plants move after being shaken; and with climbing plants\r\nit is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that the\r\nfoot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch\r\nor shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any\r\nfunctional importance to them. But plants possess, in obedience to\r\nvarious stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance\r\nto them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the light--in\r\nopposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction\r\nof gravity. When the nerves and muscles of an animal are excited by\r\ngalvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the consequent movements\r\nmay be called an incidental result, for the nerves and muscles have not\r\nbeen rendered specially sensitive to these stimuli. So with plants it\r\nappears that, from having the power of movement in obedience to certain\r\nstimuli, they are excited in an incidental manner by a touch, or by\r\nbeing shaken. Hence there is no great difficulty in admitting that in\r\nthe case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is this tendency which\r\nhas been taken advantage of and increased through natural selection. It\r\nis, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir,\r\nthat this will have occurred only with plants which had already acquired\r\nthe power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.\r\n\r\nI have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners,\r\nnamely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving\r\nmovements, which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as\r\nwell as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of\r\nthe power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes. Whether,\r\nduring the gradual development of climbing plants, natural selection\r\nhas been aided by the inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to\r\ndecide; but we know that certain periodical movements, for instance the\r\nso-called sleep of plants, are governed by habit.\r\n\r\nI have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases,\r\nselected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural\r\nselection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of\r\nuseful structures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great\r\ndifficulty on this head. A good opportunity has thus been afforded for\r\nenlarging a little on gradations of structure, often associated with\r\nstrange functions--an important subject, which was not treated at\r\nsufficient length in the former editions of this work. I will now\r\nbriefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.\r\n\r\nWith the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some\r\nextinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, etc.,\r\nand could browse a little above the average height, and the continued\r\ndestruction of those which could not browse so high, would have sufficed\r\nfor the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the prolonged\r\nuse of all the parts, together with inheritance, will have aided in an\r\nimportant manner in their co-ordination. With the many insects which\r\nimitate various objects, there is no improbability in the belief that\r\nan accidental resemblance to some common object was in each case the\r\nfoundation for the work of natural selection, since perfected through\r\nthe occasional preservation of slight variations which made the\r\nresemblance at all closer; and this will have been carried on as long\r\nas the insect continued to vary, and as long as a more and more perfect\r\nresemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted enemies. In certain\r\nspecies of whales there is a tendency to the formation of irregular\r\nlittle points of horn on the palate; and it seems to be quite within the\r\nscope of natural selection to preserve all favourable variations, until\r\nthe points were converted, first into lamellated knobs or teeth, like\r\nthose on the beak of a goose--then into short lamellae, like those of\r\nthe domestic ducks--and then into lamellae, as perfect as those of the\r\nshoveller-duck--and finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as\r\nin the mouth of the Greenland whale. In the family of the ducks, the\r\nlamellae are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as\r\na sifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith such structures as the above lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit\r\nor use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards\r\ntheir development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye\r\nof a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of\r\na prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use,\r\ntogether with inheritance. With respect to the mammae of the higher\r\nanimals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous\r\nglands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious\r\nfluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural\r\nselection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they\r\nwould have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty in understanding\r\nhow the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as\r\na defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle\r\npedicellariae, than in understanding the development of the pincers of\r\ncrustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate\r\nand penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely\r\nfor locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have\r\norgans widely different in appearance developed from the same source;\r\nand with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations\r\nmight have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids, the threads\r\nwhich originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced\r\ncohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which\r\nviscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers,\r\nand still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became\r\nattached to the free ends of the caudicles--all these gradations being\r\nof manifest benefit to the plants in question. With respect to climbing\r\nplants, I need not repeat what has been so lately said.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not\r\nthis or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it would\r\napparently have been advantageous? But it is unreasonable to expect a\r\nprecise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of the past\r\nhistory of each species, and of the conditions which at the present day\r\ndetermine its numbers and range. In most cases only general reasons,\r\nbut in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned. Thus to adapt\r\na species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated modifications are\r\nalmost indispensable, and it may often have happened that the requisite\r\nparts did not vary in the right manner or to the right degree. Many\r\nspecies must have been prevented from increasing in numbers through\r\ndestructive agencies, which stood in no relation to certain structures,\r\nwhich we imagine would have been gained through natural selection\r\nfrom appearing to us advantageous to the species. In this case, as the\r\nstruggle for life did not depend on such structures, they could not\r\nhave been acquired through natural selection. In many cases complex and\r\nlong-enduring conditions, often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for\r\nthe development of a structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom\r\nhave concurred. The belief that any given structure, which we think,\r\noften erroneously, would have been beneficial to a species, would\r\nhave been gained under all circumstances through natural selection, is\r\nopposed to what we can understand of its manner of action. Mr. Mivart\r\ndoes not deny that natural selection has effected something; but he\r\nconsiders it as \"demonstrably insufficient\" to account for the phenomena\r\nwhich I explain by its agency. His chief arguments have now been\r\nconsidered, and the others will hereafter be considered. They seem to me\r\nto partake little of the character of demonstration, and to have little\r\nweight in comparison with those in favour of the power of natural\r\nselection, aided by the other agencies often specified. I am bound to\r\nadd, that some of the facts and arguments here used by me, have been\r\nadvanced for the same purpose in an able article lately published in the\r\n\"Medico-Chirurgical Review.\"\r\n\r\nAt the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some\r\nform. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through \"an internal force\r\nor tendency,\" about which it is not pretended that anything is known.\r\nThat species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all\r\nevolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke\r\nany internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which\r\nthrough the aid of selection, by man has given rise to many well-adapted\r\ndomestic races, and which, through the aid of natural selection, would\r\nequally well give rise by graduated steps to natural races or species.\r\nThe final result will generally have been, as already explained, an\r\nadvance, but in some few cases a retrogression, in organisation.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree\r\nwith him, that new species manifest themselves \"with suddenness and by\r\nmodifications appearing at once.\" For instance, he supposes that the\r\ndifferences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse arose\r\nsuddenly. He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird \"was\r\ndeveloped in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification\r\nof a marked and important kind;\" and apparently he would extend the\r\nsame view to the wings of bats and pterodactyles. This conclusion,\r\nwhich implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me\r\nimprobable in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nEveryone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course\r\nadmit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as\r\nany single variation which we meet with under nature, or even under\r\ndomestication. But as species are more variable when domesticated or\r\ncultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable that\r\nsuch great and abrupt variations have often occurred under nature, as\r\nare known occasionally to arise under domestication. Of these latter\r\nvariations several may be attributed to reversion; and the characters\r\nwhich thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases at first\r\ngained in a gradual manner. A still greater number must be called\r\nmonstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon sheep,\r\nNiata cattle, etc.; and as they are widely different in character from\r\nnatural species, they throw very little light on our subject. Excluding\r\nsuch cases of abrupt variations, the few which remain would at best\r\nconstitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful species, closely\r\nrelated to their parental types.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as abruptly\r\nas have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely disbelieving that\r\nthey have changed in the wonderful manner indicated by Mr. Mivart, are\r\nas follows. According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marked\r\nvariations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather\r\nlong intervals of time. If such occurred under nature, they would\r\nbe liable, as formerly explained, to be lost by accidental causes of\r\ndestruction and by subsequent intercrossing; and so it is known to be\r\nunder domestication, unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially\r\npreserved and separated by the care of man. Hence, in order that a new\r\nspecies should suddenly appear in the manner supposed by Mr. Mivart,\r\nit is almost necessary to believe, in opposition to all analogy, that\r\nseveral wonderfully changed individuals appeared simultaneously within\r\nthe same district. This difficulty, as in the case of unconscious\r\nselection by man, is avoided on the theory of gradual evolution, through\r\nthe preservation of a large number of individuals, which varied more\r\nor less in any favourable direction, and of the destruction of a large\r\nnumber which varied in an opposite manner.\r\n\r\nThat many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner,\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt. The species and even the genera of many\r\nlarge natural families are so closely allied together that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish not a few of them. On every continent, in\r\nproceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, etc., we meet\r\nwith a host of closely related or representative species; as we likewise\r\ndo on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to believe were\r\nformerly connected. But in making these and the following remarks, I am\r\ncompelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed. Look at\r\nthe many outlying islands round a continent, and see how many of their\r\ninhabitants can be raised only to the rank of doubtful species. So it is\r\nif we look to past times, and compare the species which have just passed\r\naway with those still living within the same areas; or if we compare\r\nthe fossil species embedded in the sub-stages of the same geological\r\nformation. It is indeed manifest that multitudes of species are related\r\nin the closest manner to other species that still exist, or have lately\r\nexisted; and it will hardly be maintained that such species have been\r\ndeveloped in an abrupt or sudden manner. Nor should it be forgotten,\r\nwhen we look to the special parts of allied species, instead of to\r\ndistinct species, that numerous and wonderfully fine gradations can be\r\ntraced, connecting together widely different structures.\r\n\r\nMany large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that\r\nspecies have been evolved by very small steps. For instance, the fact\r\nthat the species included in the larger genera are more closely related\r\nto each other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the\r\nspecies in the smaller genera. The former are also grouped in little\r\nclusters, like varieties round species; and they present other analogies\r\nwith varieties, as was shown in our second chapter. On this same\r\nprinciple we can understand how it is that specific characters are more\r\nvariable than generic characters; and how the parts which are developed\r\nin an extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than other parts\r\nof the same species. Many analogous facts, all pointing in the same\r\ndirection, could be added.\r\n\r\nAlthough very many species have almost certainly been produced by\r\nsteps not greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may\r\nbe maintained that some have been developed in a different and abrupt\r\nmanner. Such an admission, however, ought not to be made without strong\r\nevidence being assigned. The vague and in some respects false analogies,\r\nas they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which have been\r\nadvanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden crystallisation of\r\ninorganic substances, or the falling of a facetted spheroid from one\r\nfacet to another, hardly deserve consideration. One class of facts,\r\nhowever, namely, the sudden appearance of new and distinct forms of\r\nlife in our geological formations supports at first sight the belief in\r\nabrupt development. But the value of this evidence depends entirely on\r\nthe perfection of the geological record, in relation to periods remote\r\nin the history of the world. If the record is as fragmentary as many\r\ngeologists strenuously assert, there is nothing strange in new forms\r\nappearing as if suddenly developed.\r\n\r\nUnless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr.\r\nMivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats, or\r\nthe sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light\r\nis thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of\r\nconnecting links in our geological formations. But against the belief in\r\nsuch abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest. It is notorious\r\nthat the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or other\r\nquadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period, and\r\nthat they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps. Embryological\r\nresemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter\r\nsee, by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after\r\nearly youth, and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to\r\ntheir offspring, at a corresponding age. The embryo is thus left almost\r\nunaffected, and serves as a record of the past condition of the species.\r\nHence it is that existing species during the early stages of their\r\ndevelopment so often resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the\r\nsame class. On this view of the meaning of embryological resemblances,\r\nand indeed on any view, it is incredible that an animal should have\r\nundergone such momentous and abrupt transformations as those above\r\nindicated, and yet should not bear even a trace in its embryonic\r\ncondition of any sudden modification, every detail in its structure\r\nbeing developed by insensibly fine steps.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through\r\nan internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with\r\nwings, will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all analogy,\r\nthat many individuals varied simultaneously. It cannot be denied that\r\nsuch abrupt and great changes of structure are widely different from\r\nthose which most species apparently have undergone. He will further be\r\ncompelled to believe that many structures beautifully adapted to all the\r\nother parts of the same creature and to the surrounding conditions,\r\nhave been suddenly produced; and of such complex and wonderful\r\nco-adaptations, he will not be able to assign a shadow of an\r\nexplanation. He will be forced to admit that these great and sudden\r\ntransformations have left no trace of their action on the embryo.\r\nTo admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the realms of\r\nmiracle, and to leave those of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

I may here premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of\r\nthe mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We are\r\nconcerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental\r\nfaculties in animals of the same class.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show\r\nthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;\r\nbut every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct\r\nimpels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds'\r\nnests. An action, which we ourselves require experience to enable us to\r\nperform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young\r\none, without experience, and when performed by many individuals in the\r\nsame way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is\r\nusually said to be instinctive. But I could show that none of these\r\ncharacters are universal. A little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre\r\nHuber expresses it, often comes into play, even with animals low in the\r\nscale of nature.\r\n\r\nFrederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared\r\ninstinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, an accurate notion\r\nof the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but\r\nnot necessarily of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions\r\nare performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious\r\nwill! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily\r\nbecome associated with other habits, with certain periods of time and\r\nstates of the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant\r\nthroughout life. Several other points of resemblance between instincts\r\nand habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song,\r\nso in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a\r\nperson be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is\r\ngenerally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so\r\nP. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated\r\nhammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock\r\nup to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a\r\nhammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply\r\nre-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction.\r\nIf, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for\r\ninstance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the\r\nsixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from\r\nderiving any benefit from this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order\r\nto complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage,\r\nwhere it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and it can be\r\nshown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what\r\noriginally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be\r\ndistinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three\r\nyears old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no\r\npractice at all, be might truly be said to have done so instinctively.\r\nBut it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number\r\nof instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then\r\ntransmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly\r\nshown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted,\r\nnamely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have\r\nbeen acquired by habit.\r\n\r\nIt will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as\r\ncorporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its present\r\nconditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least\r\npossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a\r\nspecies; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little,\r\nthen I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and\r\ncontinually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was\r\nprofitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and\r\nwonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal\r\nstructure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are\r\ndiminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with\r\ninstincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are in many cases of\r\nsubordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of\r\nwhat may be called spontaneous variations of instincts;--that is of\r\nvariations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight\r\ndeviations of bodily structure.\r\n\r\nNo complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection,\r\nexcept by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet\r\nprofitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,\r\nwe ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by\r\nwhich each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found\r\nonly in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in\r\nthe collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or\r\nwe ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are\r\npossible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find,\r\nmaking allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little\r\nobserved, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being\r\nknown among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to\r\nthe most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may\r\nsometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts\r\nat different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or\r\nwhen placed under different circumstances, etc.; in which case either\r\nthe one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection.\r\nAnd such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be\r\nshown to occur in nature.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my\r\ntheory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never,\r\nas far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others.\r\nOne of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an\r\naction for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that\r\nof aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first observed by Huber, their\r\nsweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following\r\nfacts show. I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides\r\non a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours.\r\nAfter this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete.\r\nI watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I\r\nthen tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well\r\nas I could, as the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted.\r\nAfterwards, I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed,\r\nby its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it\r\nhad discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the abdomen\r\nfirst of one aphis and then of another; and each, as soon as it felt the\r\nantennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop\r\nof sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. Even the quite\r\nyoung aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was\r\ninstinctive, and not the result of experience. It is certain, from the\r\nobservations of Huber, that the aphides show no dislike to the ants:\r\nif the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their\r\nexcretion. But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is no doubt a\r\nconvenience to the aphides to have it removed; therefore probably they\r\ndo not excrete solely for the good of the ants. Although there is no\r\nevidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of\r\nanother species, yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of\r\nothers, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of other\r\nspecies. So again certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely\r\nperfect; but as details on this and other such points are not\r\nindispensable, they may be here passed over.\r\n\r\nAs some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and\r\nthe inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of\r\nnatural selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but\r\nwant of space prevents me. I can only assert that instincts certainly\r\ndo vary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and\r\ndirection, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds,\r\nwhich vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the\r\nnature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes\r\nwholly unknown to us. Audubon has given several remarkable cases\r\nof differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and\r\nsouthern United States. Why, it has been asked, if instinct be variable,\r\nhas it not granted to the bee \"the ability to use some other material\r\nwhen wax was deficient?\" But what other natural material could bees\r\nuse? They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with vermilion\r\nor softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees, instead of\r\nlaboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and turpentine,\r\nwith which he had covered decorticated trees. It has lately been shown\r\nthat bees, instead of searching for pollen, will gladly use a very\r\ndifferent substance, namely, oatmeal. Fear of any particular enemy is\r\ncertainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds,\r\nthough it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the\r\nsame enemy in other animals. The fear of man is slowly acquired, as\r\nI have elsewhere shown, by the various animals which inhabit desert\r\nislands; and we see an instance of this, even in England, in the greater\r\nwildness of all our large birds in comparison with our small birds;\r\nfor the large birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely\r\nattribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in\r\nuninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the\r\nmagpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nThat the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a state\r\nof nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts. Several cases could\r\nalso be adduced of occasional and strange habits in wild animals, which,\r\nif advantageous to the species, might have given rise, through natural\r\nselection, to new instincts. But I am well aware that these general\r\nstatements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a feeble effect\r\non the reader's mind. I can only repeat my assurance, that I do not\r\nspeak without good evidence.\r\n\r\nINHERITED CHANGES OF HABIT OR INSTINCT IN DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations\r\nof instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly\r\nconsidering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus be enabled\r\nto see the part which habit and the selection of so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic\r\nanimals. It is notorious how much domestic animals vary in their mental\r\nqualities. With cats, for instance, one naturally takes to catching\r\nrats, and another mice, and these tendencies are known to be inherited.\r\nOne cat, according to Mr. St. John, always brought home game birds,\r\nanother hares or rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground and almost\r\nnightly caught woodcocks or snipes. A number of curious and authentic\r\ninstances could be given of various shades of disposition and taste, and\r\nlikewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or\r\nperiods of time. But let us look to the familiar case of the breeds\r\nof dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen\r\nstriking instances) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the\r\nvery first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some\r\ndegree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of\r\nat, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions,\r\nperformed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner\r\nby each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and\r\nwithout the end being known--for the young pointer can no more know that\r\nhe points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays\r\nher eggs on the leaf of the cabbage--I cannot see that these actions\r\ndiffer essentially from true instincts. If we were to behold one kind\r\nof wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its\r\nprey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with\r\na peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at,\r\na herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly\r\ncall these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be\r\ncalled, are certainly far less fixed than natural instincts; but\r\nthey have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have\r\nbeen transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nHow strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are\r\ninherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when\r\ndifferent breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross with\r\na bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy\r\nof greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family\r\nof shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts,\r\nwhen thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a\r\nlike manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period\r\nexhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy\r\ndescribes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog\r\nshowed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a\r\nstraight line to his master, when called.\r\n\r\nDomestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\r\ninherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is\r\nnot true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could\r\nhave taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble--an action which, as I have\r\nwitnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon\r\ntumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to\r\nthis strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best\r\nindividuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are;\r\nand near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent,\r\nwhich cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It\r\nmay be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to\r\npoint, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and\r\nthis is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a pure terrier:\r\nthe act of pointing is probably, as many have thought, only the\r\nexaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey. When the\r\nfirst tendency to point was once displayed, methodical selection and the\r\ninherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation\r\nwould soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still in\r\nprogress, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the\r\nbreed, dogs which stand and hunt best. On the other hand, habit alone\r\nin some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal is more difficult to tame\r\nthan the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the\r\nyoung of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly suppose that domestic rabbits\r\nhave often been selected for tameness alone; so that we must attribute\r\nat least the greater part of the inherited change from extreme wildness\r\nto extreme tameness, to habit and long-continued close confinement.\r\n\r\nNatural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of\r\nthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become\r\n\"broody,\" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone\r\nprevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of our\r\ndomestic animals have been modified. It is scarcely possible to doubt\r\nthat the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All wolves,\r\nfoxes, jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most\r\neager to attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been\r\nfound incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from\r\ncountries such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do\r\nnot keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do\r\nour civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to\r\nattack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an\r\nattack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed;\r\nso that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in\r\ncivilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand, young chickens\r\nhave lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt\r\nwas originally instinctive in them, for I am informed by Captain Hutton\r\nthat the young chickens of the parent stock, the Gallus bankiva, when\r\nreared in India under a hen, are at first excessively wild. So it is\r\nwith young pheasants reared in England under a hen. It is not that\r\nchickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if\r\nthe hen gives the danger chuckle they will run (more especially young\r\nturkeys) from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass\r\nor thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of\r\nallowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away.\r\nBut this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under\r\ndomestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nHence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have been\r\nacquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit and\r\npartly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive generations,\r\npeculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we\r\nmust in our ignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit\r\nalone has sufficed to produce inherited mental changes; in other cases\r\ncompulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of\r\nselection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most\r\ncases habit and selection have probably concurred.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL INSTINCTS.\r\n\r\nWe shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature\r\nhave become modified by selection by considering a few cases. I will\r\nselect only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay\r\nher eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain\r\nants; and the cell-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter\r\ninstincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the\r\nmost wonderful of all known instincts.\r\n\r\nINSTINCTS OF THE CUCKOO.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause of\r\nthe instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily, but\r\nat intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own\r\nnest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left\r\nfor some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of\r\ndifferent ages in the same nest. If this were the case the process of\r\nlaying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as\r\nshe migrates at a very early period; and the first hatched young would\r\nprobably have to be fed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is\r\nin this predicament, for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young\r\nsuccessively hatched, all at the same time. It has been both asserted\r\nand denied that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other\r\nbirds' nests; but I have lately heard from Dr. Merrill, of Iowa, that he\r\nonce found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the\r\nnest of a blue jay (Garrulus cristatus); and as both were nearly full\r\nfeathered, there could be no mistake in their identification. I could\r\nalso give several instances of various birds which have been known\r\noccasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests. Now let us suppose\r\nthat the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the habits of the\r\nAmerican cuckoo, and that she occasionally laid an egg in another bird's\r\nnest. If the old bird profited by this occasional habit through being\r\nenabled to emigrate earlier or through any other cause; or if the\r\nyoung were made more vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken\r\ninstinct of another species than when reared by their own mother,\r\nencumbered as she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of\r\ndifferent ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered\r\nyoung would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead us to believe\r\nthat the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the\r\noccasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn\r\nwould be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be\r\nmore successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of this\r\nnature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo has been\r\ngenerated. It has, also recently been ascertained on sufficient\r\nevidence, by Adolf Muller, that the cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs\r\non the bare ground, sits on them and feeds her young. This rare event\r\nis probably a case of reversion to the long-lost, aboriginal instinct of\r\nnidification.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that I have not noticed other related instincts\r\nand adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are spoken of as\r\nnecessarily co-ordinated. But in all cases, speculation on an instinct\r\nknown to us only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto\r\nhad no facts to guide us. Until recently the instincts of the European\r\nand of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing\r\nto Mr. Ramsay's observations, we have learned something about three\r\nAustralian species, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests. The\r\nchief points to be referred to are three: first, that the common cuckoo,\r\nwith rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the large and\r\nvoracious young bird receives ample food. Secondly, that the eggs are\r\nremarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark--a bird about\r\none-fourth as large as the cuckoo. That the small size of the egg is a\r\nreal case of adaptation we may infer from the fact of the mon-parasitic\r\nAmerican cuckoo laying full-sized eggs. Thirdly, that the young cuckoo,\r\nsoon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a properly shaped\r\nback for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then perish from cold and\r\nhunger. This has been boldly called a beneficent arrangement, in\r\norder that the young cuckoo may get sufficient food, and that its\r\nfoster-brothers may perish before they had acquired much feeling!\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Australian species: though these birds generally lay\r\nonly one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs\r\nin the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size,\r\nfrom eight to ten lines in length. Now, if it had been of an advantage\r\nto this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so\r\nas to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to\r\nhave been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that\r\nthere is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their\r\nincubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or\r\nspecies might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller\r\neggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared. Mr.\r\nRamsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay their\r\neggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests containing\r\neggs similar in colour to their own. The European species apparently\r\nmanifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely\r\ndeparts from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured\r\neggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs.\r\nHad our cuckoo invariably displayed the above instinct, it would\r\nassuredly have been added to those which it is assumed must all have\r\nbeen acquired together. The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary,\r\naccording to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so\r\nthat in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have\r\nsecured and fixed any advantageous variation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents\r\nare commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo is\r\nhatched; and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless condition,\r\nMr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of ejection was\r\nperformed by the foster-parents themselves. But he has now received a\r\ntrustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually seen, while\r\nstill blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in the act of\r\nejecting its foster-brothers. One of these was replaced in the nest by\r\nthe observer, and was again thrown out. With respect to the means by\r\nwhich this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of great\r\nimportance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to receive as\r\nmuch food as possible soon after birth, I can see no special difficulty\r\nin its having gradually acquired, during successive generations, the\r\nblind desire, the strength, and structure necessary for the work of\r\nejection; for those cuckoos which had such habits and structure best\r\ndeveloped would be the most securely reared. The first step towards the\r\nacquisition of the proper instinct might have been mere unintentional\r\nrestlessness on the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced\r\nin age and strength; the habit having been afterwards improved, and\r\ntransmitted to an earlier age. I can see no more difficulty in this than\r\nin the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct to break\r\nthrough their own shells; or than in young snakes acquiring in their\r\nupper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp tooth for cutting\r\nthrough the tough egg-shell. For if each part is liable to individual\r\nvariations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at\r\na corresponding or earlier age--propositions which cannot be\r\ndisputed--then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly\r\nmodified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or\r\nfall together with the whole theory of natural selection.\r\n\r\nSome species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American birds,\r\nallied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of the cuckoo;\r\nand the species present an interesting gradation in the perfection\r\nof their instincts. The sexes of Molothrus badius are stated by an\r\nexcellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live promiscuously together\r\nin flocks, and sometimes to pair. They either build a nest of their own\r\nor seize on one belonging to some other bird, occasionally throwing out\r\nthe nestlings of the stranger. They either lay their eggs in the nest\r\nthus appropriated, or oddly enough build one for themselves on the top\r\nof it. They usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own young; but\r\nMr. Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally parasitic, for\r\nhe has seen the young of this species following old birds of a distinct\r\nkind and clamouring to be fed by them. The parasitic habits of another\r\nspecies of Molothrus, the M. bonariensis, are much more highly developed\r\nthan those of the last, but are still far from perfect. This bird, as\r\nfar as it is known, invariably lays its eggs in the nests of strangers;\r\nbut it is remarkable that several together sometimes commence to build\r\nan irregular untidy nest of their own, placed in singular ill-adapted\r\nsituations, as on the leaves of a large thistle. They never, however, as\r\nfar as Mr. Hudson has ascertained, complete a nest for themselves. They\r\noften lay so many eggs--from fifteen to twenty--in the same foster-nest,\r\nthat few or none can possibly be hatched. They have, moreover, the\r\nextraordinary habit of pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their own\r\nspecies or of their foster parents, which they find in the appropriated\r\nnests. They drop also many eggs on the bare ground, which are thus\r\nwasted. A third species, the M. pecoris of North America, has acquired\r\ninstincts as perfect as those of the cuckoo, for it never lays more than\r\none egg in a foster-nest, so that the young bird is securely reared. Mr.\r\nHudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been\r\nso much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis\r\nthat he quotes my words, and asks, \"Must we consider these habits, not\r\nas especially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of\r\none general law, namely, transition?\"\r\n\r\nVarious birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay their eggs\r\nin the nests of other birds. This habit is not very uncommon with the\r\nGallinaceae, and throws some light on the singular instinct of the\r\nostrich. In this family several hen birds unite and lay first a few eggs\r\nin one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males.\r\nThis instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens\r\nlaying a large number of eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at intervals of\r\ntwo or three days. The instinct, however, of the American ostrich, as\r\nin the case of the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet been perfected;\r\nfor a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in\r\none day's hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.\r\n\r\nMany bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the nests\r\nof other kinds of bees. This case is more remarkable than that of the\r\ncuckoo; for these bees have not only had their instincts but their\r\nstructure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they\r\ndo not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been\r\nindispensable if they had stored up food for their own young. Some\r\nspecies of Sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are likewise parasitic; and\r\nM. Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that, although\r\nthe Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with\r\nparalysed prey for its own larvae, yet that, when this insect finds a\r\nburrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of\r\nthe prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as\r\nwith that of the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural\r\nselection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the\r\nspecies, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are feloniously\r\nappropriated, be not thus exterminated.\r\n\r\nSLAVE-MAKING INSTINCT.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges)\r\nrufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated\r\nfather. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their\r\naid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The\r\nmales and fertile females do no work of any kind, and the workers or\r\nsterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing\r\nslaves, do no other work. They are incapable of making their own nests,\r\nor of feeding their own larvae. When the old nest is found inconvenient,\r\nand they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the\r\nmigration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws. So utterly\r\nhelpless are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without\r\na slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with\r\ntheir larvae and pupae to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they\r\ncould not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then\r\nintroduced a single slave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed\r\nand saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and\r\nput all to rights. What can be more extraordinary than these\r\nwell-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making\r\nant, it would have been hopeless to speculate how so wonderful an\r\ninstinct could have been perfected.\r\n\r\nAnother species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P.\r\nHuber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern\r\nparts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith,\r\nof the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on\r\nthis and other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of\r\nHuber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical\r\nframe of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the existence\r\nof so extraordinary an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence, I\r\nwill give the observations which I made in some little detail. I opened\r\nfourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. Males and\r\nfertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are found only in their\r\nown proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F.\r\nsanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of their\r\nred masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is great. When the\r\nnest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like\r\ntheir masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is\r\nmuch disturbed, and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the slaves work\r\nenergetically together with their masters in carrying them away to a\r\nplace of safety. Hence, it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home.\r\nDuring the months of June and July, on three successive years, I watched\r\nfor many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave\r\neither leave or enter a nest. As, during these months, the slaves are\r\nvery few in number, I thought that they might behave differently when\r\nmore numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has watched the nests at\r\nvarious hours during May, June and August, both in Surrey and Hampshire,\r\nand has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in\r\nAugust, either leave or enter the nest. Hence, he considers them as\r\nstrictly household slaves. The masters, on the other hand, may be\r\nconstantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all\r\nkinds. During the year 1860, however, in the month of July, I came\r\nacross a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I\r\nobserved a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and\r\nmarching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir tree, twenty-five\r\nyards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of\r\naphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities\r\nfor observation, the slaves in Switzerland habitually work with their\r\nmasters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in\r\nthe morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal\r\noffice is to search for aphides. This difference in the usual habits of\r\nthe masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely\r\non the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOne day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F. sanguinea from one\r\nnest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the\r\nmasters carefully carrying their slaves in their jaws instead of\r\nbeing carried by them, as in the case of F. rufescens. Another day my\r\nattention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the\r\nsame spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were\r\nvigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F.\r\nfusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of\r\nthe slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their\r\nsmall opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest,\r\ntwenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any\r\npupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F.\r\nfusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place\r\nof combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants, who\r\nperhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of\r\nanother species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still\r\nclinging to the fragments of their nest. This species is sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith.\r\nAlthough so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it\r\nferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise\r\nan independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the\r\nslave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both\r\nnests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising\r\ncourage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could\r\ndistinguish the pupae of F. fusca, which they habitually make into\r\nslaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely\r\ncapture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them;\r\nfor we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F.\r\nfusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae,\r\nor even the earth from the nest, of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but\r\nin about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants\r\nhad crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae.\r\n\r\nOne evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a\r\nnumber of these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying\r\nthe dead bodies of F. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and\r\nnumerous pupae. I traced a long file of ants burdened with booty, for\r\nabout forty yards back, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the\r\nlast individual of F. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not\r\nable to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest, however,\r\nmust have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca\r\nwere rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched\r\nmotionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of\r\nheath, an image of despair over its ravaged home.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in\r\nregard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed\r\nwhat a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with\r\nthose of the continental F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own\r\nnest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food\r\nfor itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely\r\ndependent on its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other\r\nhand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer\r\nextremely few. The masters determine when and where a new nest shall\r\nbe formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in\r\nSwitzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of\r\nthe larvae, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In\r\nSwitzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing\r\nmaterials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend and milk\r\nas it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for\r\nthe community. In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to\r\ncollect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and\r\nlarvae. So that the masters in this country receive much less service\r\nfrom their slaves than they do in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nBy what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend\r\nto conjecture. But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as I have\r\nseen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests,\r\nit is possible that such pupae originally stored as food might become\r\ndeveloped; and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then\r\nfollow their proper instincts, and do what work they could. If their\r\npresence proved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were\r\nmore advantageous to this species, to capture workers than to procreate\r\nthem--the habit of collecting pupae, originally for food, might by\r\nnatural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the\r\nvery different purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once\r\nacquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British\r\nF. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than\r\nthe same species in Switzerland, natural selection might increase and\r\nmodify the instinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to\r\nthe species--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves\r\nas is the Formica rufescens.\r\n\r\nCELL-MAKING INSTINCT OF THE HIVE-BEE.\r\n\r\nI will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely\r\ngive an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived. He must be\r\na dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so\r\nbeautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. We\r\nhear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite\r\nproblem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the\r\ngreatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption\r\nof precious wax in their construction. It has been remarked that a\r\nskilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very\r\ndifficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected\r\nby a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Granting whatever instincts\r\nyou please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make\r\nall the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are\r\ncorrectly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as at first\r\nappears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a\r\nfew simple instincts.\r\n\r\nI was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown\r\nthat the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of\r\nadjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only\r\nas a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of\r\ngradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of\r\nwork. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their\r\nold cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax,\r\nand likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At\r\nthe other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in\r\na double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism,\r\nwith the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted\r\npyramid, of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the\r\nthree which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the\r\ncomb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells\r\non the opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of\r\nthe cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee,\r\nwe have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described\r\nand figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in\r\nstructure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to\r\nthe latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells,\r\nin which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of\r\nwax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of\r\nnearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the\r\nimportant point to notice is, that these cells are always made at that\r\ndegree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or\r\nbroken into each other if the spheres had been completed; but this is\r\nnever permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between\r\nthe spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence, each cell consists of\r\nan outer spherical portion, and of two, three, or more flat surfaces,\r\naccording as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one\r\ncell rests on three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly\r\nof the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three\r\nflat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has\r\nremarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal\r\nbase of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so\r\nhere, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into\r\nthe construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the\r\nMelipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner\r\nof building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not\r\ndouble, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions,\r\nand yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.\r\n\r\nReflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made\r\nits spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of\r\nequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer,\r\nthe resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb of the\r\nhive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and\r\nthis geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up\r\nfrom his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--\r\n\r\nIf a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in\r\ntwo parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of\r\nradius x sqrt(2) or radius x 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from\r\nthe centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the\r\nsame distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and\r\nparallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several\r\nspheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of\r\nhexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three\r\nrhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have\r\nevery angle identically the same with the best measurements which have\r\nbeen made of the cells of the hive-bee. But I hear from Professor Wyman,\r\nwho has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of the\r\nworkmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much so, that\r\nwhatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if ever,\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\nHence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the\r\ninstincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very\r\nwonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as\r\nthat of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of\r\nforming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would\r\nnot be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain\r\nextent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make\r\nin wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose\r\nthe Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does\r\nher cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the\r\ngreatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what\r\ndistance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making\r\ntheir spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance,\r\nthat she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain\r\nextent; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat\r\nsurfaces. By such modifications of instincts which in themselves are not\r\nvery wonderful--hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to\r\nmake its nest--I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural\r\nselection, her inimitable architectural powers.\r\n\r\nBut this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of\r\nMr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,\r\nthick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate\r\nminute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they\r\nmade them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins,\r\nappearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of\r\nabout the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to observe that,\r\nwherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together,\r\nthey had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by\r\nthe time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the\r\nwidth of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the\r\ndiameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the\r\nbasins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred,\r\nthe bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax\r\non the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal\r\nprism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin, instead of on\r\nthe straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nI then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece of wax,\r\na thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees\r\ninstantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each\r\nother, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that\r\nthe bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth\r\nas in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the\r\nopposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and\r\nthey stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon\r\nas they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bases; and these\r\nflat bases, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax left\r\nungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along\r\nthe planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite\r\nside of the ridge of wax. In some parts, only small portions, in other\r\nparts, large portions of a rhombic plate were thus left between the\r\nopposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had\r\nnot been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the\r\nsame rate in circularly gnawing away and deepening the basins on both\r\nsides of the ridge of vermilion wax, in order to have thus succeeded in\r\nleaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work at the planes\r\nof intersection.\r\n\r\nConsidering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any\r\ndifficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip\r\nof wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper\r\nthinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has\r\nappeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly\r\nthe same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed\r\nrhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave\r\non one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly,\r\nand convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly.\r\nIn one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and\r\nallowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined\r\nthe cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had\r\nbecome PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme\r\nthinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by\r\ngnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases\r\nstand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax\r\n(which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate\r\nplane, and thus flatten it.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if\r\nthe bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could\r\nmake their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance\r\nfrom each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to\r\nmake equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break\r\ninto each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge\r\nof a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all\r\nround the comb; and they gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always\r\nworking circularly as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole\r\nthree-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only\r\nthat one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or\r\nthe two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper\r\nedges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced.\r\nSome of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated\r\nelder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy; and if I had space, I\r\ncould show that they are conformable with my theory.\r\n\r\nHuber's statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a little\r\nparallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly\r\ncorrect; the first commencement having always been a little hood of\r\nwax; but I will not here enter on details. We see how important a part\r\nexcavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a\r\ngreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax\r\nin the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between\r\ntwo adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that\r\nthey can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax\r\nround a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding\r\nin position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.\r\nBut the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being\r\nlargely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is\r\ncurious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times\r\nthicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will\r\nultimately be left. We shall understand how they work, by supposing\r\nmasons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin\r\ncutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth,\r\nvery thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the\r\ncut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge. We\r\nshall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned\r\nby a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both those just commenced and\r\nthose completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the\r\nbees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate\r\nhexagonal walls. These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained\r\nfor me, vary greatly in thickness; being, on an average of twelve\r\nmeasurements made near the border of the comb, 1/352 of an inch in\r\nthickness; whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in\r\nthe proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one\r\nmeasurements, of 1/229 of an inch. By the above singular manner of\r\nbuilding, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost\r\nultimate economy of wax.\r\n\r\nIt seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the\r\ncells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee\r\nafter working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as\r\nHuber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement\r\nof the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering\r\nthe edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin\r\nof the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin\r\nlayer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour\r\nwas most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter\r\ncould have done it with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having\r\nbeen taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into\r\nthe growing edges of the cells all round. The work of construction seems\r\nto be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively\r\nstanding at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to\r\nsweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the\r\nplanes of intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to\r\nnote in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,\r\nhow often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the\r\nsame cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nWhen bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions\r\nfor working--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the\r\nmiddle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to be built\r\nover one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations\r\nof one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting\r\nbeyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be\r\nenabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other\r\nand from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking\r\nimaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two\r\nadjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and\r\nfinish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and\r\nof the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying\r\ndown under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place\r\nbetween two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact,\r\nwhich seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that\r\nthe cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly\r\nhexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject. Nor does\r\nthere seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case\r\nof a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she were to work alternately\r\non the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same\r\ntime, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts\r\nof the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up\r\nintermediate planes.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight\r\nmodifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the\r\nindividual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how\r\na long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts,\r\nall tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could\r\nhave profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is not\r\ndifficult: cells constructed like those of the bee or the wasp gain in\r\nstrength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of\r\nwhich they are constructed. With respect to the formation of wax, it is\r\nknown that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and\r\nI am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved\r\nthat from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a\r\nhive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a prodigious\r\nquantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in\r\na hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction\r\nof their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days\r\nduring the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable\r\nto support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security\r\nof the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being\r\nsupported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey, and the\r\ntime consumed in collecting the honey, must be an important element of\r\nsuccess any family of bees. Of course the success of the species may\r\nbe dependent on the number of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite\r\ndistinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of\r\nhoney which the bees can collect. But let us suppose that this latter\r\ncircumstance determined, as it probably often has determined, whether\r\na bee allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any\r\ncountry; and let us further suppose that the community lived through the\r\nwinter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in\r\nthis case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary\r\nhumble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts led her to make her\r\nwaxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in\r\ncommon even to two adjoining cells would save some little labour and\r\nwax. Hence, it would continually be more and more advantageous to our\r\nhumble-bees, if they were to make their cells more and more regular,\r\nnearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the\r\nMelipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each\r\ncell would serve to bound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax\r\nwould be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to\r\nthe Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more\r\nregular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the\r\nspherical surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane\r\nsurfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of\r\nthe hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural\r\nselection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can\r\nsee, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.\r\n\r\nThus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that\r\nof the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken\r\nadvantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler\r\ninstincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more\r\nperfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from\r\neach other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along\r\nthe planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing that\r\nthey swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other,\r\nthan they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and\r\nof the basal rhombic plates; the motive power of the process of natural\r\nselection having been the construction of cells of due strength and of\r\nthe proper size and shape for the larvae, this being effected with the\r\ngreatest possible economy of labour and wax; that individual swarm which\r\nthus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste of honey\r\nin the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted\r\ntheir newly-acquired economical instincts to new swarms, which in their\r\nturn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO INSTINCTS:\r\nNEUTER AND STERILE INSECTS.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts\r\nthat \"the variations of structure and of instinct must have been\r\nsimultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification\r\nin the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would\r\nhave been fatal.\" The force of this objection rests entirely on the\r\nassumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt.\r\nTo take as an illustration the case of the larger titmouse, (Parus\r\nmajor) alluded to in a previous chapter; this bird often holds the seeds\r\nof the yew between its feet on a branch, and hammers with its beak till\r\nit gets at the kernel. Now what special difficulty would there be in\r\nnatural selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the\r\nshape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break open\r\nthe seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for this purpose\r\nas that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit, or compulsion, or\r\nspontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to become more and more of\r\na seed-eater? In this case the beak is supposed to be slowly modified\r\nby natural selection, subsequently to, but in accordance with, slowly\r\nchanging habits or taste; but let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow\r\nlarger from correlation with the beak, or from any other unknown cause,\r\nand it is not improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to\r\nclimb more and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct\r\nand power of the nuthatch. In this case a gradual change of structure is\r\nsupposed to lead to changed instinctive habits. To take one more case:\r\nfew instincts are more remarkable than that which leads the swift of\r\nthe Eastern Islands to make its nest wholly of inspissated saliva. Some\r\nbirds build their nests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva;\r\nand one of the swifts of North America makes its nest (as I have\r\nseen) of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this\r\nsubstance. Is it then very improbable that the natural selection of\r\nindividual swifts, which secreted more and more saliva, should at last\r\nproduce a species with instincts leading it to neglect other materials\r\nand to make its nest exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other\r\ncases. It must, however, be admitted that in many instances we cannot\r\nconjecture whether it was instinct or structure which first varied.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed\r\nto the theory of natural selection--cases, in which we cannot see how\r\nan instinct could have originated; cases, in which no intermediate\r\ngradations are known to exist; cases of instincts of such trifling\r\nimportance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural\r\nselection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals\r\nso remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their\r\nsimilarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently\r\nmust believe that they were independently acquired through natural\r\nselection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but will\r\nconfine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to\r\nme insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to\r\nthe neuters or sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters\r\noften differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males\r\nand fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nThe subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will\r\nhere take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the\r\nworkers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater\r\nthan that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can\r\nbe shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of\r\nnature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social,\r\nand it had been profitable to the community that a number should have\r\nbeen annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can\r\nsee no especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural\r\nselection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The great\r\ndifficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males\r\nand the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax, and\r\nin being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As\r\nfar as instinct alone is concerned, the wonderful difference in this\r\nrespect between the workers and the perfect females would have been\r\nbetter exemplified by the hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter\r\ninsect had been an ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly\r\nassumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through\r\nnatural selection; namely, by individuals having been born with slight\r\nprofitable modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and\r\nthat these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards. But\r\nwith the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its\r\nparents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted\r\nsuccessively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its\r\nprogeny. It may well be asked how it is possible to reconcile this case\r\nwith the theory of natural selection?\r\n\r\nFirst, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in\r\nour domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts\r\nof differences of inherited structure which are correlated with certain\r\nages and with either sex. We have differences correlated not only with\r\none sex, but with that short period when the reproductive system is\r\nactive, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws\r\nof the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the horns of\r\ndifferent breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect\r\nstate of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than\r\nthe oxen of other breeds, relatively to the length of the horns in\r\nboth the bulls and cows of these same breeds. Hence, I can see no\r\ngreat difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile\r\ncondition of certain members of insect communities; the difficulty lies\r\nin understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could\r\nhave been slowly accumulated by natural selection.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I\r\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied\r\nto the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the\r\ndesired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well\r\nmarbled together. An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered,\r\nbut the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has\r\nsucceeded. Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a\r\nbreed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,\r\ncould, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual\r\nbulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and\r\nyet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind. Here is a better and\r\nreal illustration: According to M. Verlot, some varieties of the double\r\nannual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right\r\ndegree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double\r\nand quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and\r\nfertile plants. These latter, by which alone the variety can be\r\npropagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants, and\r\nthe double sterile plants with the neuters of the same community. As\r\nwith the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has\r\nbeen applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake\r\nof gaining a serviceable end. Hence, we may conclude that slight\r\nmodifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile\r\ncondition of certain members of the community, have proved advantageous;\r\nconsequently the fertile males and females have flourished, and\r\ntransmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile\r\nmembers with the same modifications. This process must have been\r\nrepeated many times, until that prodigious amount of difference between\r\nthe fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced\r\nwhich we see in many social insects.\r\n\r\nBut we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely,\r\nthe fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the\r\nfertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost\r\nincredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.\r\nThe castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are\r\nperfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other as are any\r\ntwo species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same\r\nfamily. Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with\r\njaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the\r\nworkers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their\r\nheads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus,\r\nthe workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the\r\nworkers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen\r\nwhich secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted\r\nby the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our\r\nEuropean ants guard and imprison.\r\n\r\nIt will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the\r\nprinciple of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful\r\nand well-established facts at once annihilate the theory. In the simpler\r\ncase of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe, have been\r\nrendered different from the fertile males and females through natural\r\nselection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that\r\nthe successive, slight, profitable modifications did not first arise in\r\nall the neuters in the same nest, but in some few alone; and that by\r\nthe survival of the communities with females which produced most neuters\r\nhaving the advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to\r\nbe thus characterized. According to this view we ought occasionally\r\nto find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of\r\nstructure; and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how few\r\nneuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith\r\nhas shown that the neuters of several British ants differ surprisingly\r\nfrom each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme\r\nforms can be linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest:\r\nI have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. It sometimes\r\nhappens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most\r\nnumerous; or that both large and small are numerous, while those of an\r\nintermediate size are scanty in numbers. Formica flava has larger\r\nand smaller workers, with some few of intermediate size; and, in this\r\nspecies, as Mr. F. Smith has observed, the larger workers have simple\r\neyes (ocelli), which, though small, can be plainly distinguished,\r\nwhereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. Having\r\ncarefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm\r\nthat the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can\r\nbe accounted for merely by their proportionately lesser size; and I\r\nfully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers\r\nof intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate\r\ncondition. So that here we have two bodies of sterile workers in the\r\nsame nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision,\r\nyet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. I may\r\ndigress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful\r\nto the community, and those males and females had been continually\r\nselected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all\r\nthe workers were in this condition; we should then have had a species of\r\nant with neuters in nearly the same condition as those of Myrmica. For\r\nthe workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the\r\nmale and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.\r\n\r\nI may give one other case: so confidently did I expect occasionally to\r\nfind gradations of important structures between the different castes\r\nof neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F.\r\nSmith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver\r\nant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate\r\nthe amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual\r\nmeasurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was\r\nthe same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of whom\r\nmany were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we\r\nmust in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead\r\nof three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five\r\ntimes as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several\r\nsizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the\r\nteeth. But the important fact for us is that, though the workers can\r\nbe grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly\r\ninto each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I\r\nspeak confidently on this latter point, as Sir J. Lubbock made drawings\r\nfor me, with the camera lucida, of the jaws which I dissected from the\r\nworkers of the several sizes. Mr. Bates, in his interesting \"Naturalist\r\non the Amazons,\" has described analogous cases.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting\r\non the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should\r\nregularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or\r\nall of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly, and this is the\r\ngreatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and\r\nsimultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;\r\na graduated series having first been formed, as in the case of the\r\ndriver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in greater\r\nand greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which generated\r\nthem, until none with an intermediate structure were produced.\r\n\r\nAn analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the equally\r\ncomplex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly appearing under\r\ntwo or even three distinct female forms; and by Fritz Muller, of certain\r\nBrazilian crustaceans likewise appearing under two widely distinct male\r\nforms. But this subject need not here be discussed.\r\n\r\nI have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two\r\ndistinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same\r\nnest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has\r\noriginated. We can see how useful their production may have been to a\r\nsocial community of ants, on the same principle that the division of\r\nlabour is useful to civilised man. Ants, however, work by inherited\r\ninstincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man works by acquired\r\nknowledge and manufactured instruments. But I must confess, that, with\r\nall my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that\r\nthis principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not\r\nthe case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion. I have,\r\ntherefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient\r\nlength, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise\r\nbecause this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my\r\ntheory has encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it\r\nproves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification\r\nmay be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous\r\nvariations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit\r\nhaving been brought into play. For peculiar habits, confined to the\r\nworkers of sterile females, however long they might be followed, could\r\nnot possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave\r\ndescendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative\r\ncase of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited\r\nhabit, as advanced by Lamarck.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the mental\r\nqualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are\r\ninherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts\r\nvary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts\r\nare of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore, there is no\r\nreal difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection\r\naccumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct which are in\r\nany way useful. In many cases habit or use and disuse have probably\r\ncome into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter\r\nstrengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of\r\ndifficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other\r\nhand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are\r\nliable to mistakes; that no instinct can be shown to have been produced\r\nfor the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the\r\ninstincts of others; that the canon in natural history, of \"Natura\r\nnon facit saltum,\" is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal\r\nstructure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is\r\notherwise inexplicable--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThis theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard\r\nto instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but distinct,\r\nspecies, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under\r\nconsiderably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly\r\nthe same instincts. For instance, we can understand, on the principle of\r\ninheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America lines\r\nits nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British\r\nthrush; how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have the same\r\nextraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a\r\nhole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster through which\r\nthe males feed them and their young when hatched; how it is that the\r\nmale wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build \"cock-nests,\" to roost\r\nin, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of\r\nany other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to\r\nmy imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as\r\nthe young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the\r\nlarvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,\r\nnot as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences\r\nof one general law leading to the advancement of all organic\r\nbeings--namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Most of them\r\nhave now been discussed. One, namely, the distinctness of specific forms\r\nand their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links,\r\nis a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not\r\ncommonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently\r\nmost favourable for their presence, namely, on an extensive and\r\ncontinuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to\r\nshow, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner\r\non the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate,\r\nand, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not\r\ngraduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured,\r\nalso, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser\r\nnumbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten\r\nout and exterminated during the course of further modification and\r\nimprovement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links\r\nnot now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends, on the very\r\nprocess of natural selection, through which new varieties continually\r\ntake the places of and supplant their parent-forms. But just in\r\nproportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous\r\nscale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly\r\nexisted, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation\r\nand every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly\r\ndoes not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this,\r\nperhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged\r\nagainst my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme\r\nimperfection of the geological record.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of\r\nintermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed. I have\r\nfound it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing\r\nto myself forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them. But this is a wholly\r\nfalse view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each\r\nspecies and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor\r\nwill generally have differed in some respects from all its modified\r\ndescendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter\r\npigeons are both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all\r\nthe intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an\r\nextremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should\r\nhave no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;\r\nnone, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop\r\nsomewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds.\r\nThese two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if we\r\nhad no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would\r\nnot have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of\r\ntheir structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C. livia, whether they had\r\ndescended from this species or from some other allied species, such as\r\nC. oenas.\r\n\r\nSo with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance\r\nto the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links directly\r\nintermediate between them ever existed, but between each and an unknown\r\ncommon parent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation\r\nmuch general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some\r\npoints of structure may have differed considerably from both, even\r\nperhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence, in all such cases,\r\nwe should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more\r\nspecies, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with\r\nthat of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a\r\nnearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms might\r\nhave descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and\r\nin this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them.\r\nBut such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long\r\nperiod unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of\r\nchange; and the principle of competition between organism and organism,\r\nbetween child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all\r\ncases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and\r\nunimproved forms.\r\n\r\nBy the theory of natural selection all living species have been\r\nconnected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not\r\ngreater than we see between the natural and domestic varieties of the\r\nsame species at the present day; and these parent-species, now generally\r\nextinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient\r\nforms; and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of\r\neach great class. So that the number of intermediate and transitional\r\nlinks, between all living and extinct species, must have been\r\ninconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have\r\nlived upon the earth.\r\n\r\nON THE LAPSE OF TIME, AS INFERRED FROM THE RATE OF DEPOSITION AND EXTENT\r\nOF DENUDATION.\r\n\r\nIndependently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely\r\nnumerous connecting links, it may be objected that time cannot have\r\nsufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having\r\nbeen effected slowly. It is hardly possible for me to recall to the\r\nreader who is not a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind\r\nfeebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles\r\nLyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future\r\nhistorian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural\r\nscience, and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of\r\ntime, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study\r\nthe Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different\r\nobservers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts\r\nto give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation, or even\r\nof each stratum. We can best gain some idea of past time by knowing the\r\nagencies at work; and learning how deeply the surface of the land has\r\nbeen denuded, and how much sediment has been deposited. As Lyell has\r\nwell remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations\r\nare the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth's crust\r\nhas elsewhere undergone. Therefore a man should examine for himself the\r\ngreat piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets bringing down\r\nmud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend\r\nsomething about the duration of past time, the monuments of which we see\r\nall around us.\r\n\r\nIt is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately hard\r\nrocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases\r\nreach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat\r\ninto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is\r\ngood evidence that pure water effects nothing in wearing away rock. At\r\nlast the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and\r\nthese remaining fixed, have to be worn away atom by atom, until after\r\nbeing reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then\r\nthey are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often\r\ndo we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all\r\nthickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are\r\nabraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for\r\na few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation,\r\nwe find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round\r\na promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. The\r\nappearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years\r\nhave elapsed since the waters washed their base.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, recently learned from the observations of Ramsay, in\r\nthe van of many excellent observers--of Jukes, Geikie, Croll and\r\nothers, that subaerial degradation is a much more important agency than\r\ncoast-action, or the power of the waves. The whole surface of the land\r\nis exposed to the chemical action of the air and of the rainwater,\r\nwith its dissolved carbonic acid, and in colder countries to frost; the\r\ndisintegrated matter is carried down even gentle slopes during heavy\r\nrain, and to a greater extent than might be supposed, especially in\r\narid districts, by the wind; it is then transported by the streams\r\nand rivers, which, when rapid deepen their channels, and triturate the\r\nfragments. On a rainy day, even in a gently undulating country, we see\r\nthe effects of subaerial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down\r\nevery slope. Messrs. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the observation\r\nis a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment in the\r\nWealden district and those ranging across England, which formerly were\r\nlooked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus formed, for each\r\nline is composed of one and the same formation, while our sea-cliffs are\r\neverywhere formed by the intersection of various formations. This being\r\nthe case, we are compelled to admit that the escarpments owe their\r\norigin in chief part to the rocks of which they are composed, having\r\nresisted subaerial denudation better than the surrounding surface;\r\nthis surface consequently has been gradually lowered, with the lines of\r\nharder rock left projecting. Nothing impresses the mind with the vast\r\nduration of time, according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the\r\nconviction thus gained that subaerial agencies, which apparently have\r\nso little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn\r\naway through subaerial and littoral action, it is good, in order to\r\nappreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the\r\nmasses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, and on\r\nthe other hand the thickness of our sedimentary formations. I remember\r\nhaving been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which have been\r\nworn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of\r\none or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the\r\nlava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how\r\nfar the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same\r\nstory is told still more plainly by faults--those great cracks along\r\nwhich the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the\r\nother, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust\r\ncracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was\r\nsudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected by\r\nmany starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down\r\nthat no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. The\r\nCraven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty miles, and\r\nalong this line the vertical displacement of the strata varies from 600\r\nto 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow\r\nin Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes that\r\nthere is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there\r\nis nothing on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements;\r\nthe pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in all parts of the world the piles of sedimentary\r\nstrata are of wonderful thickness. In the Cordillera, I estimated one\r\nmass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and although conglomerates\r\nhave probably been accumulated at a quicker rate than finer sediments,\r\nyet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears\r\nthe stamp of time, they are good to show how slowly the mass must\r\nhave been heaped together. Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum\r\nthickness, from actual measurement in most cases, of the successive\r\nformations in DIFFERENT parts of Great Britain; and this is the\r\nresult:--\r\n\r\n                                                  Feet\r\n\r\n Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds)..57,154\r\n Secondary strata................................13,190\r\n Tertiary strata..................................2,240\r\n\r\n --making altogether 72,584 feet;\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters British miles.\r\nSome of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds,\r\nare thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between\r\neach successive formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists,\r\nblank periods of enormous length. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary\r\nrocks in Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has\r\nelapsed during their accumulation. The consideration of these various\r\nfacts impresses the mind almost in the same manner as does the vain\r\nendeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless this impression is partly false. Mr. Croll, in an\r\ninteresting paper, remarks that we do not err \"in forming too great a\r\nconception of the length of geological periods,\" but in estimating them\r\nby years. When geologists look at large and complicated phenomena, and\r\nthen at the figures representing several million years, the two produce\r\na totally different effect on the mind, and the figures are at once\r\npronounced too small. In regard to subaerial denudation, Mr. Croll\r\nshows, by calculating the known amount of sediment annually brought down\r\nby certain rivers, relatively to their areas of drainage, that 1,000\r\nfeet of solid rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would thus\r\nbe removed from the mean level of the whole area in the course of six\r\nmillion years. This seems an astonishing result, and some considerations\r\nlead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if halved or\r\nquartered it is still very surprising. Few of us, however, know what a\r\nmillion really means: Mr. Croll gives the following illustration: Take\r\na narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four inches in length, and\r\nstretch it along the wall of a large hall; then mark off at one end\r\nthe tenth of an inch. This tenth of an inch will represent one hundred\r\nyears, and the entire strip a million years. But let it be borne in\r\nmind, in relation to the subject of this work, what a hundred years\r\nimplies, represented as it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a\r\nhall of the above dimensions. Several eminent breeders, during a single\r\nlifetime, have so largely modified some of the higher animals, which\r\npropagate their kind much more slowly than most of the lower animals,\r\nthat they have formed what well deserves to be called a new sub-breed.\r\nFew men have attended with due care to any one strain for more than half\r\na century, so that a hundred years represents the work of two breeders\r\nin succession. It is not to be supposed that species in a state of\r\nnature ever change so quickly as domestic animals under the guidance of\r\nmethodical selection. The comparison would be in every way fairer\r\nwith the effects which follow from unconscious selection, that is, the\r\npreservation of the most useful or beautiful animals, with no intention\r\nof modifying the breed; but by this process of unconscious selection,\r\nvarious breeds have been sensibly changed in the course of two or three\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nSpecies, however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same\r\ncountry only a few change at the same time. This slowness follows from\r\nall the inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted to\r\neach other, that new places in the polity of nature do not occur until\r\nafter long intervals, due to the occurrence of physical changes of some\r\nkind, or through the immigration of new forms. Moreover, variations\r\nor individual differences of the right nature, by which some of the\r\ninhabitants might be better fitted to their new places under the altered\r\ncircumstance, would not always occur at once. Unfortunately we have no\r\nmeans of determining, according to the standard of years, how long a\r\nperiod it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of time we must\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nON THE POORNESS OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we\r\nbehold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted by every one. The\r\nremark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, should never\r\nbe forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and\r\nnamed from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens\r\ncollected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the\r\nearth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient\r\ncare, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove.\r\nNo organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and\r\ndisappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not\r\naccumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume\r\nthat sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea,\r\nat a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains.\r\nThroughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue\r\ntint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a\r\nformation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by\r\nanother and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered\r\nin the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view\r\nof the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered\r\ncondition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel,\r\nwill, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the\r\npercolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many\r\nkinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark\r\nseem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of the\r\nChthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all\r\nover the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with\r\nthe exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep\r\nwater and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other\r\nspecies has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is\r\nknown that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period.\r\nLastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their\r\naccumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our\r\nbeing able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is\r\nthat of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone,\r\nseveral thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness,\r\nand extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and\r\nalthough this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils,\r\nexcept a few vegetable remains, have been found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\r\nSecondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that\r\nour evidence is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For instance, until\r\nrecently not a land-shell was known belonging to either of these vast\r\nperiods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C. Lyell\r\nand Dr. Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America; but now\r\nland-shells have been found in the lias. In regard to mammiferous\r\nremains, a glance at the historical table published in Lyell's\r\nManual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their\r\npreservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity\r\nsurprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of\r\ntertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine\r\ndeposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging\r\nto the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.\r\n\r\nBut the imperfection in the geological record largely results from\r\nanother and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from\r\nthe several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals\r\nof time. This doctrine has been emphatically admitted by many geologists\r\nand palaeontologists, who, like E. Forbes, entirely disbelieve in the\r\nchange of species. When we see the formations tabulated in written\r\nworks, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid\r\nbelieving that they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance,\r\nfrom Sir R. Murchison's great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are\r\nin that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in\r\nNorth America, and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful\r\ngeologist, if his attention had been confined exclusively to these large\r\nterritories, would never have suspected that during the periods which\r\nwere blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment,\r\ncharged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been\r\naccumulated. And if, in every separate territory, hardly any idea can be\r\nformed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive\r\nformations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained.\r\nThe frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition\r\nof consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the\r\ngeography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment was derived,\r\naccord with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between\r\neach formation.\r\n\r\nWe can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are\r\nalmost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other\r\nin close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many\r\nhundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised\r\nseveral hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of\r\nany recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short\r\ngeological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by\r\na peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no\r\nrecord of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be\r\npreserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why, along\r\nthe rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive\r\nformations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though\r\nthe supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous\r\ndegradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy streams entering the\r\nsea. The explanation, no doubt, is that the littoral and sub-littoral\r\ndeposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by\r\nthe slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of\r\nthe coast-waves.\r\n\r\nWe may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely\r\nthick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant\r\naction of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent\r\noscillations of level, as well as the subsequent subaerial degradation.\r\nSuch thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two\r\nways; either in profound depths of the sea, in which case the bottom\r\nwill not be inhabited by so many and such varied forms of life as the\r\nmore shallow seas; and the mass when upraised will give an imperfect\r\nrecord of the organisms which existed in the neighbourhood during\r\nthe period of its accumulation. Or sediment may be deposited to any\r\nthickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to\r\nsubside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and\r\nsupply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain\r\nshallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich\r\nfossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large\r\namount of denudation, may be formed.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are\r\nthroughout the greater part of their thickness RICH IN FOSSILS, have\r\nthus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this\r\nsubject in 1845, I have watched the progress of geology, and have been\r\nsurprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that\r\ngreat formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated\r\nduring subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation\r\non the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to\r\nresist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will\r\nhardly last to a distant geological age, was deposited during a downward\r\noscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nAll geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone\r\nnumerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations\r\nhave affected wide spaces. Consequently, formations rich in fossils and\r\nsufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will\r\nhave been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only\r\nwhere the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and\r\nto embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the\r\nother hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK\r\ndeposits cannot have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are\r\nthe most favourable to life. Still less can this have happened during\r\nthe alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the\r\nbeds which were then accumulated will generally have been destroyed by\r\nbeing upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral deposits. In the\r\ncase of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that within a large part\r\nof the Malay Archipelago, where the depth varies from thirty or forty\r\nto sixty fathoms, a widely extended formation might be formed during\r\na period of elevation, and yet not suffer excessively from denudation\r\nduring its slow upheaval; but the thickness of the formation could not\r\nbe great, for owing to the elevatory movement it would be less than\r\nthe depth in which it was formed; nor would the deposit be much\r\nconsolidated, nor be capped by overlying formations, so that it would\r\nrun a good chance of being worn away by atmospheric degradation and by\r\nthe action of the sea during subsequent oscillations of level. It has,\r\nhowever, been suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the area,\r\nafter rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit formed\r\nduring the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards become\r\nprotected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of\r\nconsiderable horizontal extent have rarely been completely destroyed.\r\nBut all geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present\r\nmetamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial\r\nnucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks have been\r\nstripped of their covering to an enormous extent. For it is scarcely\r\npossible that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallised\r\nwhile uncovered; but if the metamorphic action occurred at profound\r\ndepths of the ocean, the former protecting mantle of rock may not have\r\nbeen very thick. Admitting then that gneiss, mica-schist, granite,\r\ndiorite, etc., were once necessarily covered up, how can we account for\r\nthe naked and extensive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world,\r\nexcept on the belief that they have subsequently been completely denuded\r\nof all overlying strata? That such extensive areas do exist cannot be\r\ndoubted: the granitic region of Parime is described by Humboldt as being\r\nat least nineteen times as large as Switzerland. South of the Amazon,\r\nBoue colours an area composed of rocks of this nature as equal to that\r\nof Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all\r\nconjoined. This region has not been carefully explored, but from the\r\nconcurrent testimony of travellers, the granitic area is very large:\r\nthus Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these rocks, stretching\r\nfrom Rio de Janeiro for 260 geographical miles inland in a straight\r\nline; and I travelled for 150 miles in another direction, and saw\r\nnothing but granitic rocks. Numerous specimens, collected along the\r\nwhole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a\r\ndistance of 1,100 geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all\r\nbelonged to this class. Inland, along the whole northern bank of the\r\nPlata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of\r\nslightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the\r\noriginal capping of the granitic series. Turning to a well-known region,\r\nnamely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor H.D.\r\nRogers' beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by cutting out and\r\nweighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic (excluding the\r\n\"semi-metamorphic\") and granite rocks exceed, in the proportion of 19 to\r\n12.5, the whole of the newer Palaeozoic formations. In many regions the\r\nmetamorphic and granite rocks would be found much more widely extended\r\nthan they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were removed which\r\nrest unconformably on them, and which could not have formed part of\r\nthe original mantle under which they were crystallised. Hence, it is\r\nprobable that in some parts of the world whole formations have been\r\ncompletely denuded, with not a wreck left behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation\r\nthe area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will\r\nbe increased and new stations will often be formed--all circumstances\r\nfavourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties\r\nand species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank\r\nin the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the\r\ninhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting on\r\nthe shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and\r\nconsequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction,\r\nfew new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very\r\nperiods of subsidence that the deposits which are richest in fossils\r\nhave been accumulated.\r\n\r\nON THE ABSENCE OF NUMEROUS INTERMEDIATE VARIETIES IN ANY SINGLE\r\nFORMATION.\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the\r\ngeological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if\r\nwe confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more\r\ndifficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated\r\nvarieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and\r\nat its close. Several cases are on record of the same species presenting\r\nvarieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation. Thus\r\nTrautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf\r\nhas described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis\r\nmultiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in\r\nSwitzerland. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast\r\nnumber of years for its deposition, several reasons can be given why\r\neach should not commonly include a graduated series of links between the\r\nspecies which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign\r\ndue proportional weight to the following considerations.\r\n\r\nAlthough each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each\r\nprobably is short compared with the period requisite to change one\r\nspecies into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose\r\nopinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have\r\nconcluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice\r\nas long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable\r\ndifficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us from coming to any just\r\nconclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the\r\nmiddle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer\r\nthat it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again, when we find\r\na species disappearing before the last layers have been deposited, it\r\nwould be equally rash to suppose that it then became extinct. We forget\r\nhow small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world;\r\nnor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been\r\ncorrelated with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there has been\r\na large amount of migration due to climatal and other changes; and when\r\nwe see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is\r\nthat it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for\r\ninstance, that several species appear somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic\r\nbeds of North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently\r\nbeen required for their migration from the American to the European\r\nseas. In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of the\r\nworld, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing\r\nspecies are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the\r\nimmediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant\r\nin the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular\r\ndeposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount\r\nof migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch,\r\nwhich forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to\r\nreflect on the changes of level, on the extreme change of climate,\r\nand on the great lapse of time, all included within this same glacial\r\nperiod. Yet it may be doubted whether, in any quarter of the\r\nworld, sedimentary deposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on\r\naccumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It is\r\nnot, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole\r\nof the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that\r\nlimit of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we know\r\nthat great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America\r\nduring this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow\r\nwater near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial\r\nperiod shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first\r\nappear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migrations\r\nof species and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a\r\ngeologist, examining these beds, would be tempted to conclude that the\r\naverage duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that\r\nof the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that\r\nis, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper\r\nand lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on\r\ncontinuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow\r\nprocess of modification; hence, the deposit must be a very thick one;\r\nand the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district\r\nthroughout the whole time. But we have seen that a thick formation,\r\nfossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only\r\nduring a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the\r\nsame, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the\r\nsame space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the\r\namount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will tend to\r\nsubmerge the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the\r\nsupply, whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly\r\nexact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of\r\nsubsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed\r\nby more than one palaeontologist that very thick deposits are usually\r\nbarren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of\r\nformations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its\r\naccumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed\r\nof beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we may\r\nreasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more or less\r\ninterrupted. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give us any\r\nidea of the length of time which its deposition may have consumed.\r\nMany instances could be given of beds, only a few feet in thickness,\r\nrepresenting formations which are elsewhere thousands of feet in\r\nthickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their\r\naccumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have even suspected\r\nthe vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases\r\ncould be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised,\r\ndenuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same\r\nformation--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals\r\nhave occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest\r\nevidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew,\r\nof many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process\r\nof deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not the trees\r\nbeen preserved: thus Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found carboniferous\r\nbeds 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata,\r\none above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels.\r\nHence, when the same species occurs at the bottom, middle, and top of\r\na formation, the probability is that it has not lived on the same\r\nspot during the whole period of deposition, but has disappeared and\r\nreappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period.\r\nConsequently if it were to undergo a considerable amount of modification\r\nduring the deposition of any one geological formation, a section would\r\nnot include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on our\r\ntheory have existed, but abrupt, though perhaps slight, changes of form.\r\n\r\nIt is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule\r\nby which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little\r\nvariability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater\r\namount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,\r\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest\r\nintermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we\r\ncan seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B\r\nand C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an older and\r\nunderlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C,\r\nit would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the\r\nsame time it could be closely connected by intermediate varieties\r\nwith either one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before\r\nexplained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet\r\nwould not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all\r\nrespects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several\r\nmodified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same\r\nformation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we\r\nshould not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently\r\nrank them as distinct species.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious on what excessively slight differences many\r\npalaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more\r\nreadily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same\r\nformation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the\r\nvery fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;\r\nand on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on\r\nthe theory we ought to find. Look again at the later tertiary deposits,\r\nwhich include many shells believed by the majority of naturalists to\r\nbe identical with existing species; but some excellent naturalists,\r\nas Agassiz and Pictet, maintain that all these tertiary species are\r\nspecifically distinct, though the distinction is admitted to be very\r\nslight; so that here, unless we believe that these eminent naturalists\r\nhave been misled by their imaginations, and that these late tertiary\r\nspecies really present no difference whatever from their living\r\nrepresentatives, or unless we admit, in opposition to the judgment of\r\nmost naturalists, that these tertiary species are all truly distinct\r\nfrom the recent, we have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight\r\nmodifications of the kind required. If we look to rather wider intervals\r\nof time, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great\r\nformation, we find that the embedded fossils, though universally ranked\r\nas specifically different, yet are far more closely related to each\r\nother than are the species found in more widely separated formations;\r\nso that here again we have undoubted evidence of change in the direction\r\nrequired by the theory; but to this latter subject I shall return in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\nWith animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander\r\nmuch, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their\r\nvarieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties\r\ndo not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until they have been\r\nmodified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this\r\nview, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all\r\nthe early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the\r\nsuccessive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some\r\none spot. Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that\r\nwith plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest\r\npresent varieties, so that, with shells and other marine animals, it is\r\nprobable that those which had the widest range, far exceeding the limits\r\nof the known geological formations in Europe, have oftenest given rise,\r\nfirst to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again\r\nwould greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of\r\ntransition in any one geological formation.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration, leading to the same result, as\r\nlately insisted on by Dr. Falconer, namely, that the period during which\r\neach species underwent modification, though long as measured by years,\r\nwas probably short in comparison with that during which it remained\r\nwithout undergoing any change.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect\r\nspecimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by\r\nintermediate varieties, and thus proved to be the same species, until\r\nmany specimens are collected from many places; and with fossil\r\nspecies this can rarely be done. We shall, perhaps, best perceive the\r\nimprobability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine,\r\nintermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance,\r\ngeologists at some future period will be able to prove that our\r\ndifferent breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs are descended from\r\na single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether\r\ncertain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are\r\nranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European\r\nrepresentatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are\r\nreally varieties, or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This\r\ncould be effected by the future geologist only by his discovering in\r\na fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is\r\nimprobable in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe in\r\nthe immutability of species, that geology yields no linking forms. This\r\nassertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is certainly erroneous.\r\nAs Sir J. Lubbock has remarked, \"Every species is a link between other\r\nallied forms.\" If we take a genus having a score of species, recent\r\nand extinct, and destroy four-fifths of them, no one doubts that the\r\nremainder will stand much more distinct from each other. If the extreme\r\nforms in the genus happen to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself\r\nwill stand more distinct from other allied genera. What geological\r\nresearch has not revealed, is the former existence of infinitely\r\nnumerous gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together\r\nnearly all existing and extinct species. But this ought not to be\r\nexpected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious\r\nobjection against my views.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the causes\r\nof the imperfection of the geological record under an imaginary\r\nillustration. The Malay Archipelago is about the size of Europe from\r\nthe North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and\r\ntherefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined\r\nwith any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I\r\nfully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and\r\nshallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, while most\r\nof our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of\r\nthe richest regions in organic beings; yet if all the species were to\r\nbe collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they\r\nrepresent the natural history of the world!\r\n\r\nBut we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of\r\nthe archipelago would be preserved in an extremely imperfect manner in\r\nthe formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. Not many\r\nof the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked\r\nsubmarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or\r\nsand would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not\r\naccumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a\r\nsufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nFormations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness sufficient to\r\nlast to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie\r\nin the past, would generally be formed in the archipelago only during\r\nperiods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated\r\nfrom each other by immense intervals of time, during which the area\r\nwould be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, the fossiliferous\r\nformations on the steeper shores would be destroyed, almost as soon as\r\naccumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores\r\nof South America. Even throughout the extensive and shallow seas within\r\nthe archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of\r\ngreat thickness during the periods of elevation, or become capped\r\nand protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a good chance of\r\nenduring to a very distant future. During the periods of subsidence,\r\nthere would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods\r\nof elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record\r\nwould then be less perfect.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\r\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with\r\na contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average\r\nduration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are\r\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\r\nbetween any two or more species. If such gradations were not all fully\r\npreserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many new,\r\nthough closely allied species. It is also probable that each great\r\nperiod of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level,\r\nand that slight climatical changes would intervene during such lengthy\r\nperiods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would\r\nmigrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could\r\nbe preserved in any one formation.\r\n\r\nVery many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range\r\nthousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy plainly leads to the\r\nbelief that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species, though\r\nonly some of them, which would oftenest produce new varieties; and\r\nthe varieties would at first be local or confined to one place, but\r\nif possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and\r\nimproved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms. When\r\nsuch varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ\r\nfrom their former state in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely\r\nslight degree, and as they would be found embedded in slightly\r\ndifferent sub-stages of the same formation, they would, according to\r\nthe principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nIf then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right\r\nto expect to find, in our geological formations, an infinite number of\r\nthose fine transitional forms, which, on our theory, have connected\r\nall the past and present species of the same group into one long and\r\nbranching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, and such\r\nassuredly we do find--some more distantly, some more closely, related\r\nto each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in\r\ndifferent stages of the same formation, would, by many palaeontologists,\r\nbe ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever\r\nhave suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved geological\r\nsections, had not the absence of innumerable transitional links between\r\nthe species which lived at the commencement and close of each formation,\r\npressed so hardly on my theory.\r\n\r\nON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in\r\ncertain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists--for\r\ninstance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the\r\nbelief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging\r\nto the same genera or families, have really started into life at once,\r\nthe fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural\r\nselection. For the development by this means of a group of forms, all\r\nof which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an\r\nextremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long before\r\ntheir modified descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection\r\nof the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or\r\nfamilies have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not\r\nexist before that stage. In all cases positive palaeontological evidence\r\nmay be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience\r\nhas so often shown. We continually forget how large the world is,\r\ncompared with the area over which our geological formations have been\r\ncarefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere\r\nhave long existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they invaded the\r\nancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States. We do not make\r\ndue allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed\r\nbetween our consecutive formations, longer perhaps in many cases\r\nthan the time required for the accumulation of each formation. These\r\nintervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from\r\nsome one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups or\r\nspecies will appear as if suddenly created.\r\n\r\nI may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might require\r\na long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar\r\nline of life, for instance, to fly through the air; and consequently\r\nthat the transitional forms would often long remain confined to some one\r\nregion; but that, when this adaptation had once been effected, and a\r\nfew species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms,\r\na comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent\r\nforms, which would spread rapidly and widely throughout the world.\r\nProfessor Pictet, in his excellent Review of this work, in commenting\r\non early transitional forms, and taking birds as an illustration, cannot\r\nsee how the successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a supposed\r\nprototype could possibly have been of any advantage. But look at the\r\npenguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their front limbs\r\nin this precise intermediate state of \"neither true arms nor true\r\nwings?\" Yet these birds hold their place victoriously in the battle for\r\nlife; for they exist in infinite numbers and of many kinds. I do not\r\nsuppose that we here see the real transitional grades through which\r\nthe wings of birds have passed; but what special difficulty is there in\r\nbelieving that it might profit the modified descendants of the penguin,\r\nfirst to become enabled to flap along the surface of the sea like the\r\nlogger-headed duck, and ultimately to rise from its surface and glide\r\nthrough the air?\r\n\r\nI will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing remarks, and\r\nto show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of\r\nspecies have suddenly been produced. Even in so short an interval as\r\nthat between the first and second editions of Pictet's great work on\r\nPalaeontology, published in 1844-46 and in 1853-57, the conclusions on\r\nthe first appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals\r\nhave been considerably modified; and a third edition would require still\r\nfurther changes. I may recall the well-known fact that in geological\r\ntreatises, published not many years ago, mammals were always spoken of\r\nas having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series.\r\nAnd now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs\r\nto the middle of the secondary series; and true mammals have been\r\ndiscovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of\r\nthis great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any\r\ntertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India,\r\nSouth America and in Europe, as far back as the miocene stage. Had it\r\nnot been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps in\r\nthe new red sandstone of the United States, who would have ventured to\r\nsuppose that no less than at least thirty different bird-like animals,\r\nsome of gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a fragment of\r\nbone has been discovered in these beds. Not long ago, palaeontologists\r\nmaintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence\r\nduring the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor\r\nOwen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper\r\ngreensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx,\r\nwith a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint,\r\nand with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in\r\nthe oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more\r\nforcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nI may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own eyes\r\nhas much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I stated\r\nthat, from the large number of existing and extinct tertiary species;\r\nfrom the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species\r\nall over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting\r\nvarious zones of depths, from the upper tidal limits to fifty fathoms;\r\nfrom the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest\r\ntertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve\r\ncan be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that, had\r\nsessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would\r\ncertainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had\r\nthen been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great\r\ngroup had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary\r\nseries. This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then thought, one\r\nmore instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But\r\nmy work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M.\r\nBosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakable\r\nsessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of\r\nBelgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this\r\ncirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus,\r\nof which not one species has as yet been found even in any tertiary\r\nstratum. Still more recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct\r\nsubfamily of sessile cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in\r\nthe upper chalk; so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence\r\nof this group of animals during the secondary period.\r\n\r\nThe case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the\r\napparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the\r\nteleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the Chalk period.\r\nThis group includes the large majority of existing species. But certain\r\nJurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be teleostean;\r\nand even some palaeozoic forms have thus been classed by one high\r\nauthority. If the teleosteans had really appeared suddenly in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere at the commencement of the chalk formation, the\r\nfact would have been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an\r\ninsuperable difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that at\r\nthe same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously developed\r\nin other quarters of the world. It is almost superfluous to remark\r\nthat hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and\r\nby running through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that very few\r\nspecies are known from several formations in Europe. Some few families\r\nof fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes might formerly\r\nhave had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely\r\ndeveloped in some one sea, have spread widely. Nor have we any right to\r\nsuppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from\r\nsouth to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay\r\nArchipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian\r\nOcean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any\r\ngreat group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would\r\nremain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler\r\nclimate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or\r\nAustralia, and thus reach other and distant seas.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of other\r\ncountries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States, and\r\nfrom the revolution in our palaeontological knowledge effected by the\r\ndiscoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me to be about as rash\r\nto dogmatize on the succession of organic forms throughout the world, as\r\nit would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren\r\npoint in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN\r\nFOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.\r\n\r\nThere is another and allied difficulty, which is much more serious. I\r\nallude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known\r\nfossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that\r\nall the existing species of the same group are descended from a single\r\nprogenitor, apply with equal force to the earliest known species.\r\nFor instance, it cannot be doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian\r\ntrilobites are descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived\r\nlong before the Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly from\r\nany known animal. Some of the most ancient animals, as the Nautilus,\r\nLingula, etc., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on\r\nour theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of\r\nall the species belonging to the same groups which have subsequently\r\nappeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate in character.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before the\r\nlowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as,\r\nor probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age\r\nto the present day; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed\r\nwith living creatures. Here we encounter a formidable objection; for it\r\nseems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state for the habitation of\r\nliving creatures, has lasted long enough. Sir W. Thompson concludes that\r\nthe consolidation of the crust can hardly have occurred less than twenty\r\nor more than four hundred million years ago, but probably not less than\r\nninety-eight or more than two hundred million years. These very wide\r\nlimits show how doubtful the data are; and other elements may have\r\nhereafter to be introduced into the problem. Mr. Croll estimates that\r\nabout sixty million years have elapsed since the Cambrian period,\r\nbut this, judging from the small amount of organic change since the\r\ncommencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very short time for the\r\nmany and great mutations of life, which have certainly occurred since\r\nthe Cambrian formation; and the previous one hundred and forty million\r\nyears can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the\r\nvaried forms of life which already existed during the Cambrian period.\r\nIt is, however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the\r\nworld at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent\r\nchanges in its physical conditions than those now occurring; and such\r\nchanges would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding rate in\r\nthe organisms which then existed.\r\n\r\nTo the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging\r\nto these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can\r\ngive no satisfactory answer. Several eminent geologists, with Sir R.\r\nMurchison at their head, were until recently convinced that we beheld\r\nin the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the first dawn\r\nof life. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and E. Forbes, have\r\ndisputed this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion\r\nof the world is known with accuracy. Not very long ago M. Barrande\r\nadded another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar species,\r\nbeneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower down in the\r\nLower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales beds rich in\r\ntrilobites, and containing various molluscs and annelids. The presence\r\nof phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter, even in some of the\r\nlowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at these periods; and\r\nthe existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian formation of Canada is\r\ngenerally admitted. There are three great series of strata beneath the\r\nSilurian system in Canada, in the lowest of which the Eozoon is found.\r\nSir W. Logan states that their \"united thickness may possibly far\r\nsurpass that of all the succeeding rocks, from the base of the\r\npalaeozoic series to the present time. We are thus carried back to a\r\nperiod so remote, that the appearance of the so-called primordial\r\nfauna (of Barrande) may by some be considered as a comparatively modern\r\nevent.\" The Eozoon belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes of\r\nanimals, but is highly organised for its class; it existed in countless\r\nnumbers, and, as Dr. Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on other\r\nminute organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers. Thus the\r\nwords, which I wrote in 1859, about the existence of living beings long\r\nbefore the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same with those\r\nsince used by Sir W. Logan, have proved true. Nevertheless, the\r\ndifficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast piles\r\nof strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very great. It\r\ndoes not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been quite worn\r\naway by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly obliterated\r\nby metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we should have\r\nfound only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in\r\nage, and these would always have existed in a partially metamorphosed\r\ncondition. But the descriptions which we possess of the Silurian\r\ndeposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not\r\nsupport the view that the older a formation is the more invariably it\r\nhas suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThe case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as\r\na valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it\r\nmay hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following\r\nhypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear\r\nto have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe\r\nand of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in\r\nthickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from\r\nfirst to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was\r\nderived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents\r\nof Europe and North America. This same view has since been maintained by\r\nAgassiz and others. But we do not know what was the state of things in\r\nthe intervals between the several successive formations; whether Europe\r\nand the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as\r\na submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or\r\nas the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.\r\n\r\nLooking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the\r\nland, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly\r\noceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be called\r\na truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any\r\npalaeozoic or secondary formation. Hence, we may perhaps infer, that\r\nduring the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor\r\ncontinental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they\r\nexisted, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability\r\nhave been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear;\r\nand would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of\r\nlevel, which must have intervened during these enormously long periods.\r\nIf, then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that,\r\nwhere our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest\r\nperiod of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where\r\ncontinents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no\r\ndoubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period. The\r\ncoloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude\r\nthat the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great\r\narchipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents\r\nareas of elevation. But we have no reason to assume that things have\r\nthus remained from the beginning of the world. Our continents seem to\r\nhave been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of\r\nlevel, of the force of elevation. But may not the areas of preponderant\r\nmovement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent\r\nto the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are\r\nnow spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our\r\ncontinents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if,\r\nfor instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a\r\ncontinent we should there find sedimentary formations, in recognisable\r\ncondition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing such to have been\r\nformerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had\r\nsubsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had\r\nbeen pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might\r\nhave undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always\r\nremained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the\r\nworld, for instance in South America, of naked metamorphic rocks, which\r\nmust have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to\r\nrequire some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see\r\nin these large areas the many formations long anterior to the Cambrian\r\nepoch in a completely metamorphosed and denuded condition.\r\n\r\nThe several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we find in\r\nour geological formations many links between the species which now exist\r\nand which formerly existed, we do not find infinitely numerous fine\r\ntransitional forms closely joining them all together. The sudden\r\nmanner in which several groups of species first appear in our European\r\nformations, the almost entire absence, as at present known, of\r\nformations rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian strata, are all\r\nundoubtedly of the most serious nature. We see this in the fact that\r\nthe most eminent palaeontologists, namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande,\r\nPictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as\r\nLyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently,\r\nmaintained the immutability of species. But Sir Charles Lyell now\r\ngives the support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most\r\ngeologists and palaeontologists are much shaken in their former belief.\r\nThose who believe that the geological record is in any degree perfect,\r\nwill undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out\r\nLyell's metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of\r\nthe world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect. Of this\r\nhistory we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three\r\ncountries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been\r\npreserved, and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each\r\nword of the slowly-changing language, more or less different in the\r\nsuccessive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are entombed\r\nin our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to have been\r\nabruptly introduced. On this view the difficulties above discussed are\r\ngreatly diminished or even disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"XI","numeral":"XI","title":" ON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.","text":"CHAPTER XI. ON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.\r\n\r\n On the slow and successive appearance of new species--On their different\r\n rates of change--Species once lost do not reappear--Groups of species\r\n follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as\r\n do single species--On extinction--On simultaneous changes in the forms\r\n of life throughout the world--On the affinities of extinct species to\r\n each other and to living species--On the state of development of\r\n ancient forms--On the succession of the same types within the same\r\n areas--Summary of preceding and present chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the\r\ngeological succession of organic beings accord best with the common view\r\nof the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual\r\nmodification, through variation and natural selection.\r\n\r\nNew species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the\r\nland and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to\r\nresist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary\r\nstages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between the stages,\r\nand to make the proportion between the lost and existing forms more\r\ngradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high\r\nantiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are extinct,\r\nand only one or two are new, having appeared there for the first time,\r\neither locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. The\r\nsecondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,\r\nneither the appearance nor disappearance of the many species embedded in\r\neach formation has been simultaneous.\r\n\r\nSpecies belonging to different genera and classes have not changed at\r\nthe same rate, or in the same degree. In the older tertiary beds a few\r\nliving shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct\r\nforms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an\r\nexisting crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in\r\nthe sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from\r\nthe living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian\r\nMolluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions\r\nof the land seem to have changed at a quicker rate than those of the\r\nsea, of which a striking instance has been observed in Switzerland.\r\nThere is some reason to believe that organisms high in the scale, change\r\nmore quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to\r\nthis rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is not\r\nthe same in each successive so-called formation. Yet if we compare any\r\nbut the most closely related formations, all the species will be found\r\nto have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared\r\nfrom the face of the earth, we have no reason to believe that the same\r\nidentical form ever reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this\r\nlatter rule is that of the so-called \"colonies\" of M. Barrande, which\r\nintrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow\r\nthe pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely,\r\nthat it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical\r\nprovince, seems satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThese several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no fixed\r\nlaw of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to change\r\nabruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of\r\nmodification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few species\r\nat the same time; for the variability of each species is independent of\r\nthat of all others. Whether such variations or individual differences as\r\nmay arise will be accumulated through natural selection in a greater\r\nor less degree, thus causing a greater or less amount of permanent\r\nmodification, will depend on many complex contingencies--on\r\nthe variations being of a beneficial nature, on the freedom of\r\nintercrossing, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the\r\ncountry, on the immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of the\r\nother inhabitants with which the varying species come into competition.\r\nHence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the\r\nsame identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, should\r\nchange in a less degree. We find similar relations between the existing\r\ninhabitants of distinct countries; for instance, the land-shells and\r\ncoleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ considerably from\r\ntheir nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine\r\nshells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand\r\nthe apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly\r\norganised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by\r\nthe more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When\r\nmany of the inhabitants of any area have become modified and improved,\r\nwe can understand, on the principle of competition, and from the\r\nall-important relations of organism to organism in the struggle for\r\nlife, that any form which did not become in some degree modified and\r\nimproved, would be liable to extermination. Hence, we see why all\r\nthe species in the same region do at last, if we look to long enough\r\nintervals of time, become modified; for otherwise they would become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nIn members of the same class the average amount of change, during long\r\nand equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the\r\naccumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils, depends on great\r\nmasses of sediment being deposited on subsiding areas, our formations\r\nhave been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly\r\nintermittent intervals of time; consequently the amount of organic\r\nchange exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations\r\nis not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and\r\ncomplete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at\r\nhazard, in an ever slowly changing drama.\r\n\r\nWe can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\r\nreappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and\r\ninorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might\r\nbe adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances)\r\nto fill the place of another species in the economy of nature, and\r\nthus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be\r\nidentically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different\r\ncharacters from their distinct progenitors; and organisms already\r\ndiffering would vary in a different manner. For instance, it is\r\npossible, if all our fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers might\r\nmake a new breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed; but if\r\nthe parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we have\r\nevery reason to believe that parent forms are generally supplanted\r\nand exterminated by their improved offspring, it is incredible that a\r\nfantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any\r\nother species of pigeon, or even from any other well established race\r\nof the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations would almost\r\ncertainly be in some degree different, and the newly-formed variety\r\nwould probably inherit from its progenitor some characteristic\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nGroups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general\r\nrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species,\r\nchanging more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A\r\ngroup, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that is, its\r\nexistence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there\r\nare some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are\r\nsurprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though\r\nall strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and\r\nthe rule strictly accords with the theory. For all the species of\r\nthe same group, however long it may have lasted, are the modified\r\ndescendants one from the other, and all from a common progenitor. In\r\nthe genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have successively\r\nappeared at all ages must have been connected by an unbroken series of\r\ngenerations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species sometimes\r\nfalsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have attempted\r\nto give an explanation of this fact, which if true would be fatal to my\r\nviews. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being\r\na gradual increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and\r\nthen, sooner or later, a gradual decrease. If the number of the species\r\nincluded within a genus, or the number of the genera within a family, be\r\nrepresented by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending through\r\nthe successive geological formations, in which the species are found,\r\nthe line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in\r\na sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, often\r\nkeeping of equal thickness for a space, and ultimately thins out in the\r\nupper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species.\r\nThis gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly\r\nconformable with the theory; for the species of the same genus, and the\r\ngenera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively;\r\nthe process of modification and the production of a number of allied\r\nforms necessarily being a slow and gradual process, one species first\r\ngiving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted\r\ninto species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other\r\nvarieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree\r\nfrom a single stem, till the group becomes large.\r\n\r\nON EXTINCTION.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of species\r\nand of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection, the\r\nextinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are\r\nintimately connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of\r\nthe earth having been swept away by catastrophes at successive periods\r\nis very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de\r\nBeaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally\r\nlead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to\r\nbelieve, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and\r\ngroups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one\r\nspot, then from another, and finally from the world. In some few cases,\r\nhowever, as by the breaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption\r\nof a multitude of new inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final\r\nsubsidence of an island, the process of extinction may have been rapid.\r\nBoth single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal\r\nperiods; some groups, as we have seen, have endured from the earliest\r\nknown dawn of life to the present day; some have disappeared before\r\nthe close of the palaeozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine\r\nthe length of time during which any single species or any single genus\r\nendures. There is reason to believe that the extinction of a whole group\r\nof species is generally a slower process than their production: if their\r\nappearance and disappearance be represented, as before, by a vertical\r\nline of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at\r\nits upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its\r\nlower end, which marks the first appearance and the early increase in\r\nnumber of the species. In some cases, however, the extermination of\r\nwhole groups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary\r\nperiod, has been wonderfully sudden.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous\r\nmystery. Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a\r\ndefinite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one can\r\nhave marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species. When\r\nI found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of\r\nMastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon and other extinct monsters, which all\r\nco-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period,\r\nI was filled with astonishment; for, seeing that the horse, since its\r\nintroduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the\r\nwhole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I\r\nasked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse\r\nunder conditions of life apparently so favourable. But my astonishment\r\nwas groundless. Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though\r\nso like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had\r\nthis horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist\r\nwould have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the\r\nattribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries.\r\nIf we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that\r\nsomething is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that\r\nsomething is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil\r\nhorse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain, from\r\nthe analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant,\r\nand from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in\r\nSouth America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very\r\nfew years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not have\r\ntold what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase,\r\nwhether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the\r\nhorse's life, and in what degree they severally acted. If the conditions\r\nhad gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we\r\nassuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would\r\ncertainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct--its place\r\nbeing seized on by some more successful competitor.\r\n\r\nIt is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every\r\nliving creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile\r\nagencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient\r\nto cause rarity, and finally extinction. So little is this subject\r\nunderstood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly expressed at such\r\ngreat monsters as the Mastodon and the more ancient Dinosaurians having\r\nbecome extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the battle of\r\nlife. Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine, as has\r\nbeen remarked by Owen, quicker extermination, from the greater amount\r\nof requisite food. Before man inhabited India or Africa, some cause must\r\nhave checked the continued increase of the existing elephant. A highly\r\ncapable judge, Dr. Falconer, believes that it is chiefly insects which,\r\nfrom incessantly harassing and weakening the elephant in India, check\r\nits increase; and this was Bruce's conclusion with respect to\r\nthe African elephant in Abyssinia. It is certain that insects and\r\nblood-sucking bats determine the existence of the larger naturalised\r\nquadrupeds in several parts of South America.\r\n\r\nWe see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity\r\nprecedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of\r\nevents with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally\r\nor wholly, through man's agency. I may repeat what I published in 1845,\r\nnamely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they\r\nbecome extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet\r\nto marvel greatly when the species ceases to exist, is much the same as\r\nto admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to\r\nfeel no surprise at sickness, but, when the sick man dies, to wonder and\r\nto suspect that he died by some deed of violence.\r\n\r\nThe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\r\nvariety and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by\r\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;\r\nand the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably\r\nfollows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and\r\nslightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the\r\nless improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it\r\nis transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the\r\nplace of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new\r\nforms and the disappearance of old forms, both those naturally and\r\nartificially produced, are bound together. In flourishing groups, the\r\nnumber of new specific forms which have been produced within a given\r\ntime has at some periods probably been greater than the number of\r\nthe old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that\r\nspecies have not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the\r\nlater geological epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may believe\r\nthat the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the\r\nsame number of old forms.\r\n\r\nThe competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained\r\nand illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each\r\nother in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of\r\na species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;\r\nand if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the\r\nnearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will\r\nbe the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of\r\nnew species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to\r\nsupplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must often\r\nhave happened that a new species belonging to some one group has seized\r\non the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and\r\nthus have caused its extermination. If many allied forms be developed\r\nfrom the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places;\r\nand it will generally be the allied forms, which will suffer from some\r\ninherited inferiority in common. But whether it be species belonging\r\nto the same or to a distinct class, which have yielded their places to\r\nother modified and improved species, a few of the sufferers may often\r\nbe preserved for a long time, from being fitted to some peculiar line of\r\nlife, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they\r\nwill have escaped severe competition. For instance, some species of\r\nTrigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survive\r\nin the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost\r\nextinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.\r\nTherefore, the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have\r\nseen, a slower process than its production.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or\r\norders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period, and of\r\nAmmonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what\r\nhas been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our\r\nconsecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been\r\nmuch slow extermination. Moreover, when, by sudden immigration or by\r\nunusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken\r\npossession of an area, many of the older species will have been\r\nexterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms which thus\r\nyield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of the\r\nsame inferiority in common.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole\r\ngroups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural\r\nselection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it\r\nbe at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand\r\nthe many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species\r\ndepends. If we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase\r\ninordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom\r\nperceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured.\r\nWhenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant\r\nin individuals than that; why this species and not another can be\r\nnaturalised in a given country; then, and not until then, we may justly\r\nfeel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of any particular\r\nspecies or group of species.\r\n\r\nON THE FORMS OF LIFE CHANGING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE\r\nWORLD.\r\n\r\nScarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact\r\nthat the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\r\nworld. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many\r\ndistant regions, under the most different climates, where not a fragment\r\nof the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in\r\nequatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nand in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the organic\r\nremains in certain beds present an unmistakable resemblance to those\r\nof the Chalk. It is not that the same species are met with; for in some\r\ncases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to\r\nthe same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are\r\nsimilarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial\r\nsculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of\r\nEurope, but which occur in the formations either above or below, occur\r\nin the same order at these distant points of the world. In the several\r\nsuccessive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North\r\nAmerica, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed\r\nby several authors; so it is, according to Lyell, with the European and\r\nNorth American tertiary deposits. Even if the few fossil species which\r\nare common to the Old and New Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the\r\ngeneral parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic\r\nand tertiary stages, would still be manifest, and the several formations\r\ncould be easily correlated.\r\n\r\nThese observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the\r\nworld: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions\r\nof the land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same\r\nparallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the\r\nMegatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought\r\nto Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their\r\ngeological position, no one would have suspected that they had\r\nco-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as these anomalous\r\nmonsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least\r\nhave been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nWhen the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\r\nsimultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this\r\nexpression relates to the same year, or even to the same century, or\r\neven that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine\r\nanimals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during\r\nthe pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by years,\r\nincluding the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now existing\r\nin South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would\r\nhardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene inhabitants\r\nof Europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. So,\r\nagain, several highly competent observers maintain that the existing\r\nproductions of the United States are more closely related to those which\r\nlived in Europe during certain late tertiary stages, than to the\r\npresent inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is evident that\r\nfossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North America would\r\nhereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds.\r\nNevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can be little\r\ndoubt that all the more modern MARINE formations, namely, the upper\r\npliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of Europe, North and\r\nSouth America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some\r\ndegree allied, and from not including those forms which are found\r\nonly in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as\r\nsimultaneous in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large\r\nsense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable\r\nobservers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After referring to the\r\nparallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe,\r\nthey add, \"If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to\r\nNorth America, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena,\r\nit will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their\r\nextinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere\r\nchanges in marine currents or other causes more or less local and\r\ntemporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal\r\nkingdom.\" M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same\r\neffect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents,\r\nclimate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great\r\nmutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most\r\ndifferent climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some\r\nspecial law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present\r\ndistribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation\r\nbetween the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of\r\ntheir inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life\r\nthroughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection.\r\nNew species are formed by having some advantage over older forms; and\r\nthe forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the\r\nother forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of\r\nnew varieties or incipient species. We have distinct evidence on this\r\nhead, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest and\r\nmost widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new varieties.\r\nIt is also natural that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species,\r\nwhich have already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of\r\nother species, should be those which would have the best chance of\r\nspreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to other\r\nnew varieties and species. The process of diffusion would often be\r\nvery slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange\r\naccidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new species to the\r\nvarious climates through which they might have to pass, but in the\r\ncourse of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading\r\nand would ultimately prevail. The diffusion would, it is probable, be\r\nslower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with\r\nthe marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We might therefore expect\r\nto find, as we do find, a less strict degree of parallelism in the\r\nsuccession of the productions of the land than with those of the sea.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,\r\nsimultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,\r\naccords well with the principle of new species having been formed by\r\ndominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus\r\nproduced being themselves dominant, owing to their having had some\r\nadvantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over other\r\nspecies; and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms. The\r\nold forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and\r\nvictorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting\r\nsome inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and improved groups\r\nspread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world; and\r\nthe succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in their\r\nfirst appearance and final disappearance.\r\n\r\nThere is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I\r\nhave given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations,\r\nrich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that\r\nblank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned,\r\noccurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either\r\nstationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down\r\nquickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During these\r\nlong and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region\r\nunderwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and\r\nthat there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have\r\nreason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,\r\nit is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been\r\naccumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world;\r\nbut we are very far from having any right to conclude that this has\r\ninvariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been\r\naffected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited\r\nin two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period,\r\nwe should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing\r\nparagraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the\r\nspecies would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a\r\nlittle more time in the one region than in the other for modification,\r\nextinction, and immigration.\r\n\r\nI suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in\r\nhis admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is\r\nable to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages\r\nin the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England\r\nwith those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in\r\nthe numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species\r\nthemselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering\r\nthe proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an\r\nisthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous\r\nfaunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later\r\ntertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking\r\ngeneral parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and\r\nScandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in\r\nthe species. If the several formations in these regions have not been\r\ndeposited during the same exact periods--a formation in one region often\r\ncorresponding with a blank interval in the other--and if in both regions\r\nthe species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the\r\nseveral formations and during the long intervals of time between them;\r\nin this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged\r\nin the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the\r\nforms of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly\r\nparallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the\r\napparently corresponding stages in the two regions.\r\n\r\nON THE AFFINITIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO LIVING FORMS.\r\n\r\nLet us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.\r\nAll fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained on\r\nthe principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a\r\ngeneral rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago\r\nremarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing\r\ngroups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill\r\nup the intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is\r\ncertainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even\r\ndenied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give\r\nsome instances. If we confine our attention either to the living or to\r\nthe extinct species of the same class, the series is far less perfect\r\nthan if we combine both into one general system. In the writings of\r\nProfessor Owen we continually meet with the expression of generalised\r\nforms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of\r\nprophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that such forms\r\nare, in fact, intermediate or connecting links. Another distinguished\r\npalaeontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that\r\nmany of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break\r\ndown the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants\r\nand Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so\r\nmany fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter the\r\nwhole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the same\r\nsub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by gradations the\r\napparently wide interval between the pig and the camel. The Ungulata\r\nor hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the even-toed or odd-toed\r\ndivisions; but the Macrauchenia of South America connects to a certain\r\nextent these two grand divisions. No one will deny that the Hipparion\r\nis intermediate between the existing horse and certain other ungulate\r\nforms. What a wonderful connecting link in the chain of mammals is the\r\nTypotherium from South America, as the name given to it by Professor\r\nGervais expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order. The\r\nSirenia form a very distinct group of the mammals, and one of the most\r\nremarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is the entire\r\nabsence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being left; but the\r\nextinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified\r\nthigh-bone \"articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis,\" and\r\nit thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the\r\nSirenia are in other respects allied. The cetaceans or whales are\r\nwidely different from all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and\r\nSqualodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in an order\r\nby themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly\r\ncetaceans, \"and to constitute connecting links with the aquatic\r\ncarnivora.\"\r\n\r\nEven the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown by\r\nthe naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the\r\nmost unexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct\r\nArcheopteryx, and on the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of\r\nthe Dinosaurians--that group which includes the most gigantic of all\r\nterrestrial reptiles. Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a\r\nhigher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that,\r\nalthough palaeozoic animals can certainly be classed under existing\r\ngroups, yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so\r\ndistinctly separated from each other as they now are.\r\n\r\nSome writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of species,\r\nbeing considered as intermediate between any two living species, or\r\ngroups of species. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is\r\ndirectly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or\r\ngroups, the objection is probably valid. But in a natural classification\r\nmany fossil species certainly stand between living species, and some\r\nextinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to\r\ndistinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very\r\ndistinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing\r\nthem to be distinguished at the present day by a score of characters,\r\nthe ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of\r\ncharacters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer\r\napproach to each other than they now do.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the\r\nmore it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely\r\nseparated from each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted\r\nto those groups which have undergone much change in the course of\r\ngeological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of\r\nthe proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the\r\nLepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very\r\ndistinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,\r\nthe older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the\r\nrecent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is truth in\r\nthe remark.\r\n\r\nLet us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\r\ntheory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex,\r\nI must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.\r\nWe may suppose that the numbered letters in italics represent genera,\r\nand the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. The\r\ndiagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being\r\ngiven, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal lines may\r\nrepresent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath\r\nthe uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The three existing\r\ngenera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14, a closely\r\nallied family or subfamily; and o14, i14, m14, a third family. These\r\nthree families, together with the many extinct genera on the several\r\nlines of descent diverging from the parent form (A) will form an order;\r\nfor all will have inherited something in common from their ancient\r\nprogenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence\r\nof character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more\r\nrecent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient\r\nprogenitor. Hence, we can understand the rule that the most ancient\r\nfossils differ most from existing forms. We must not, however, assume\r\nthat divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends\r\nsolely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize\r\non many and different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is\r\nquite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms,\r\nthat a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its\r\nslightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast\r\nperiod the same general characteristics. This is represented in the\r\ndiagram by the letter F14.\r\n\r\nAll the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as\r\nbefore remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects\r\nof extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into\r\nseveral sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have\r\nperished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms\r\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered\r\nat several points low down in the series, the three existing families on\r\nthe uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If,\r\nfor instance, the genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9, were disinterred,\r\nthese three families would be so closely linked together that they\r\nprobably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the\r\nsame manner as has occurred with ruminants and certain pachyderms. Yet\r\nhe who objected to consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which\r\nthus link together the living genera of three families, would be partly\r\njustified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long\r\nand circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many\r\nextinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal\r\nlines or geological formations--for instance, above No. VI.--but none\r\nfrom beneath this line, then only two of the families (those on the left\r\nhand a14, etc., and b14, etc.) would have to be united into one; and\r\nthere would remain two families which would be less distinct from each\r\nother than they were before the discovery of the fossils. So again, if\r\nthe three families formed of eight genera (a14 to m14), on the uppermost\r\nline, be supposed to differ from each other by half-a-dozen important\r\ncharacters, then the families which existed at a period marked VI would\r\ncertainly have differed from each other by a less number of characters;\r\nfor they would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less\r\ndegree from their common progenitor. Thus it comes that ancient and\r\nextinct genera are often in a greater or less degree intermediate\r\nin character between their modified descendants, or between their\r\ncollateral relations.\r\n\r\nUnder nature the process will be far more complicated than is\r\nrepresented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous;\r\nthey will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will\r\nhave been modified in various degrees. As we possess only the last\r\nvolume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition,\r\nwe have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to fill up the wide\r\nintervals in the natural system, and thus to unite distinct families or\r\norders. All that we have a right to expect is, that those groups which\r\nhave, within known geological periods, undergone much modification,\r\nshould in the older formations make some slight approach to each other;\r\nso that the older members should differ less from each other in some of\r\ntheir characters than do the existing members of the same groups;\r\nand this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists is\r\nfrequently the case.\r\n\r\nThus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with\r\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each\r\nother and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory manner. And\r\nthey are wholly inexplicable on any other view.\r\n\r\nOn this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one great\r\nperiod in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character\r\nbetween that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus the\r\nspecies which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram\r\nare the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and\r\nare the parents of those which became still more modified at the\r\nseventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in\r\ncharacter between the forms of life above and below. We must, however,\r\nallow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and in any one\r\nregion for the immigration of new forms from other regions, and for a\r\nlarge amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between\r\nthe successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of\r\neach geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between\r\nthe preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance,\r\nnamely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system,\r\nwhen this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by\r\npalaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the\r\noverlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems. But each fauna\r\nis not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time\r\nhave elapsed between consecutive formations.\r\n\r\nIt is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of\r\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\r\npreceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions\r\nto the rule. For instance, the species of mastodons and elephants, when\r\narranged by Dr. Falconer in two series--in the first place according\r\nto their mutual affinities, and in the second place according to their\r\nperiods of existence--do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme\r\nin character are not the oldest or the most recent; nor are those which\r\nare intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for\r\nan instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first\r\nappearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far\r\nfrom the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively\r\nproduced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A very\r\nancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form\r\nelsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial\r\nproductions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with\r\ngreat; if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon\r\nwere arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely\r\naccord with the order in time of their production, and even less with\r\nthe order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon still\r\nlives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier\r\nhave become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important\r\ncharacter of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked\r\ntumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an\r\nintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character,\r\nis the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two\r\nconsecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than\r\nare the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known\r\ninstance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the\r\nseveral stages of the Chalk formation, though the species are distinct\r\nin each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have\r\nshaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of species.\r\nHe who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the\r\nglobe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of distinct\r\nspecies in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of\r\nthe ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered\r\nthat the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed\r\nalmost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most\r\ndifferent climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes\r\nof climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole\r\nglacial epoch, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants\r\nof the sea have been affected.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains from\r\nclosely consecutive formations, being closely related, though ranked as\r\ndistinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation\r\nhas often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened\r\nbetween successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as\r\nI attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two\r\nformations, all the intermediate varieties between the species which\r\nappeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but we ought\r\nto find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only\r\nmoderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as\r\nthey have been called by some authors, representative species; and these\r\nassuredly we do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and\r\nscarcely sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the right to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nON THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ANCIENT COMPARED WITH LIVING FORMS.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of differentiation\r\nand specialisation of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at\r\nmaturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of\r\nperfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the specialisation of\r\nparts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend to\r\nrender the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect,\r\nand in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with\r\nsimple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life,\r\nand in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet\r\nleaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life.\r\nIn another and more general manner, new species become superior to their\r\npredecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all\r\nthe older forms, with which they come into close competition. We may\r\ntherefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene\r\ninhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the existing\r\ninhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by the\r\nlatter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palaeozoic by\r\nthe secondary forms. So that by this fundamental test of victory in the\r\nbattle for life, as well as by the standard of the specialisation of\r\norgans, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to\r\nstand higher than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of\r\npalaeontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this\r\nanswer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.\r\n\r\nIt is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain Brachiopods\r\nhave been but slightly modified from an extremely remote geological\r\nepoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have remained nearly\r\nthe same, from the time when, as far as is known, they first appeared.\r\nIt is not an insuperable difficulty that Foraminifera have not, as\r\ninsisted on by Dr. Carpenter, progressed in organisation since even the\r\nLaurentian epoch; for some organisms would have to remain fitted for\r\nsimple conditions of life, and what could be better fitted for this end\r\nthan these lowly organised Protozoa? Such objections as the above\r\nwould be fatal to my view, if it included advance in organisation as\r\na necessary contingent. They would likewise be fatal, if the above\r\nForaminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first come into\r\nexistence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above Brachiopods during\r\nthe Cambrian formation; for in this case, there would not have been time\r\nsufficient for the development of these organisms up to the standard\r\nwhich they had then reached. When advanced up to any given point, there\r\nis no necessity, on the theory of natural selection, for their further\r\ncontinued process; though they will, during each successive age, have to\r\nbe slightly modified, so as to hold their places in relation to slight\r\nchanges in their conditions. The foregoing objections hinge on the\r\nquestion whether we really know how old the world is, and at what period\r\nthe various forms of life first appeared; and this may well be disputed.\r\n\r\nThe problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in\r\nmany ways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all times\r\nimperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable\r\nclearness that within the known history of the world organisation has\r\nlargely advanced. Even at the present day, looking to members of the\r\nsame class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to be ranked\r\nas highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from their\r\napproach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as the\r\nhighest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest. The ganoids\r\nstand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter\r\nat the present day are largely preponderant in number; but formerly\r\nselaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case, according to\r\nthe standard of highness chosen, so will it be said that fishes have\r\nadvanced or retrograded in organisation. To attempt to compare members\r\nof distinct types in the scale of highness seems hopeless; who will\r\ndecide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a bee--that insect which\r\nthe great Von Baer believed to be \"in fact more highly organised than a\r\nfish, although upon another type?\" In the complex struggle for life it\r\nis quite credible that crustaceans, not very high in their own class,\r\nmight beat cephalopods, the highest molluscs; and such crustaceans,\r\nthough not highly developed, would stand very high in the scale of\r\ninvertebrate animals, if judged by the most decisive of all trials--the\r\nlaw of battle. Beside these inherent difficulties in deciding which\r\nforms are the most advanced in organisation, we ought not solely to\r\ncompare the highest members of a class at any two periods--though\r\nundoubtedly this is one and perhaps the most important element in\r\nstriking a balance--but we ought to compare all the members, high\r\nand low, at two periods. At an ancient epoch the highest and lowest\r\nmolluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in\r\nnumbers; at the present time both groups are greatly reduced,\r\nwhile others, intermediate in organisation, have largely increased;\r\nconsequently some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more\r\nhighly developed than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on\r\nthe opposite side, by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and\r\nthe fact that our existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more\r\nhighly organised than their ancient representatives. We ought also to\r\ncompare the relative proportional numbers, at any two periods, of the\r\nhigh and low classes throughout the world: if, for instance, at the\r\npresent day fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if\r\nwe knew that at some former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we\r\nought to look at this increase in number in the highest class, which\r\nimplies a great displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the\r\norganisation of the world. We thus see how hopelessly difficult it is to\r\ncompare with perfect fairness, under such extremely complex relations,\r\nthe standard of organisation of the imperfectly-known faunas of\r\nsuccessive periods.\r\n\r\nWe shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to certain\r\nexisting faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner in which\r\nEuropean productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have\r\nseized on places which must have been previously occupied by the\r\nindigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and plants of Great\r\nBritain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of British forms would\r\nin the course of time become thoroughly naturalized there, and would\r\nexterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from the fact that\r\nhardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become wild in\r\nany part of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the productions\r\nof New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any considerable number\r\nwould be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants\r\nand animals. Under this point of view, the productions of Great Britain\r\nstand much higher in the scale than those of New Zealand. Yet the\r\nmost skilful naturalist, from an examination of the species of the two\r\ncountries, could not have foreseen this result.\r\n\r\nAgassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancient\r\nanimals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals\r\nbelonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession of\r\nextinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development of\r\nexisting forms. This view accords admirably well with our theory. In a\r\nfuture chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its\r\nembryo, owing to variations having supervened at a not early age, and\r\nhaving been inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it\r\nleaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of\r\nsuccessive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the\r\nembryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of\r\nthe former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be\r\ntrue, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance, that\r\nthe oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to their\r\nproper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree\r\nless distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same\r\ngroups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having\r\nthe common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds rich\r\nin fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest Cambrian strata--a\r\ndiscovery of which the chance is small.\r\n\r\nON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SAME TYPES WITHIN THE SAME AREAS, DURING THE\r\nLATER TERTIARY PERIODS.\r\n\r\nMr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the\r\nAustralian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that\r\ncontinent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to\r\nan uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like those of the\r\narmadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has\r\nshown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,\r\nburied there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This\r\nrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of\r\nfossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was\r\nso much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839\r\nand 1845, on this \"law of the succession of types,\"--on \"this wonderful\r\nrelationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.\"\r\nProfessor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to\r\nthe mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author's\r\nrestorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see\r\nit also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that\r\nthe same law holds good with sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution\r\nof most molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases could\r\nbe added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of\r\nMadeira; and between the extinct and living brackish water-shells of the\r\nAralo-Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nNow, what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types\r\nwithin the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after comparing\r\nthe present climate of Australia and of parts of South America, under\r\nthe same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand through\r\ndissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants\r\nof these two continents; and, on the other hand through similarity\r\nof conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each continent\r\nduring the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is\r\nan immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely\r\nproduced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should\r\nhave been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in\r\nancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown\r\nin the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of\r\ndistribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it\r\nnow is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present character\r\nof the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was\r\nformerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern\r\nhalf. In a similar manner we know, from Falconer and Cautley's\r\ndiscoveries, that Northern India was formerly more closely related in\r\nits mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts\r\ncould be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long\r\nenduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the\r\nsame areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of\r\nthe world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next\r\nsucceeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified\r\ndescendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed\r\ngreatly from those of another continent, so will their modified\r\ndescendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. But\r\nafter very long intervals of time, and after great geographical changes,\r\npermitting much intermigration, the feebler will yield to the more\r\ndominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the distribution\r\nof organic beings.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the megatherium and\r\nother allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in South America, have\r\nleft behind them the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate\r\ndescendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals\r\nhave become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves\r\nof Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in\r\nsize and in all other characters to the species still living in South\r\nAmerica; and some of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors\r\nof the living species. It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all\r\nthe species of the same genus are the descendants of some one species;\r\nso that, if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one\r\ngeological formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six other\r\nallied or representative genera, each with the same number of species,\r\nthen we may conclude that generally only one species of each of the\r\nolder genera has left modified descendants, which constitute the new\r\ngenera containing the several species; the other seven species of each\r\nold genus having died out and left no progeny. Or, and this will be a\r\nfar commoner case, two or three species in two or three alone of the six\r\nolder genera will be the parents of the new genera: the other species\r\nand the other old genera having become utterly extinct. In failing\r\norders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as is the case\r\nwith the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will\r\nleave modified blood-descendants.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely\r\nimperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically\r\nexplored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have\r\nbeen largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of\r\nspecimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as\r\nnothing compared with the number of generations which must have passed\r\naway even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being\r\nalmost necessary for the accumulation of deposits rich in fossil species\r\nof many kinds, and thick enough to outlast future degradation, great\r\nintervals of time must have elapsed between most of our successive\r\nformations; that there has probably been more extinction during\r\nthe periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods\r\nof elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least\r\nperfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously\r\ndeposited; that the duration of each formation is probably short\r\ncompared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has\r\nplayed an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any\r\none area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have\r\nvaried most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new species;\r\nthat varieties have at first been local; and lastly, although each\r\nspecies must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is\r\nprobable that the periods, during which each underwent modification,\r\nthough many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison\r\nwith the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition.\r\nThese causes, taken conjointly, will to a large extent explain\r\nwhy--though we do find many links--we do not find interminable\r\nvarieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the\r\nfinest graduated steps. It should also be constantly borne in mind that\r\nany linking variety between two forms, which might be found, would be\r\nranked, unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new\r\nand distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure\r\ncriterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.\r\n\r\nHe who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record,\r\nwill rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are\r\nthe numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the\r\nclosely allied or representative species, found in the successive stages\r\nof the same great formation? He may disbelieve in the immense intervals\r\nof time which must have elapsed between our consecutive formations;\r\nhe may overlook how important a part migration has played, when the\r\nformations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are considered;\r\nhe may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in\r\nof whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of those\r\ninfinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the\r\nCambrian system was deposited? We now know that at least one animal did\r\nthen exist; but I can answer this last question only by supposing that\r\nwhere our oceans now extend they have extended for an enormous period,\r\nand where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood since the\r\ncommencement of the Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch,\r\nthe world presented a widely different aspect; and that the older\r\ncontinents, formed of formations older than any known to us, exist now\r\nonly as remnants in a metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nPassing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts\r\nin palaeontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with\r\nmodification through variation and natural selection. We can thus\r\nunderstand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively;\r\nhow species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or\r\nat the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all\r\nundergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the\r\nalmost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can\r\nunderstand why, when a species has once disappeared, it never reappears.\r\nGroups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal\r\nperiods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily\r\nslow, and depends on many complex contingencies. The dominant species\r\nbelonging to large and dominant groups tend to leave many modified\r\ndescendants, which form new sub-groups and groups. As these are\r\nformed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority\r\ninherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and\r\nto leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the\r\nutter extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow\r\nprocess, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected\r\nand isolated situations. When a group has once wholly disappeared, it\r\ndoes not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread widely and\r\nyield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the world with\r\nallied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed\r\nin displacing the groups which are their inferiors in the struggle for\r\nexistence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the\r\nworld appear to have changed simultaneously.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and\r\nrecent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand, from the\r\ncontinued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient\r\na form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why\r\nancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing\r\nforms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct\r\ninto one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer together.\r\nThe more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some degree\r\nintermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form\r\nis, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble,\r\nthe common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct\r\nforms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are\r\nintermediate only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct\r\nand different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of\r\nclosely consecutive formations are closely allied; for they are closely\r\nlinked together by generation. We can clearly see why the remains of an\r\nintermediate formation are intermediate in character.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history\r\nhave beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so\r\nfar, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally become more\r\nspecialised; and this may account for the common belief held by so many\r\npalaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. Extinct\r\nand ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the more\r\nrecent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fact\r\nreceives a simple explanation according to our views. The succession\r\nof the same types of structure within the same areas during the later\r\ngeological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on the\r\nprinciple of inheritance.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and\r\nit may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much\r\nmore perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are\r\ngreatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws\r\nof palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have\r\nbeen produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted\r\nby new and improved forms of life, the products of variation and the\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"XII","numeral":"XII","title":" GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.","text":"CHAPTER XII. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical\r\n conditions--Importance of barriers--Affinity of the productions of the\r\n same continent--Centres of creation--Means of dispersal by changes of\r\n climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means--Dispersal\r\n during the Glacial period--Alternate Glacial periods in the North and\r\n South.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of\r\nthe globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the\r\nsimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions\r\ncan be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical conditions.\r\nOf late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to\r\nthis conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove\r\nits truth; for if we exclude the arctic and northern temperate parts,\r\nall authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in\r\ngeographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet\r\nif we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of\r\nthe United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most\r\ndiversified conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains,\r\ngrassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers, under almost\r\nevery temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old\r\nWorld which cannot be paralleled in the New--at least so closely as the\r\nsame species generally require. No doubt small areas can be pointed out\r\nin the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but these are not\r\ninhabited by a fauna different from that of the surrounding districts;\r\nfor it is rare to find a group of organisms confined to a small area,\r\nof which the conditions are peculiar in only a slight degree.\r\nNotwithstanding this general parallelism in the conditions of Old and\r\nNew Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in\r\nAustralia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes\r\n25 and 35 degrees, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their\r\nconditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas\r\nand floras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may compare the\r\nproductions of South America south of latitude 35 degrees with those\r\nnorth of 25 degrees, which consequently are separated by a space of\r\nten degrees of latitude, and are exposed to considerably different\r\nconditions; yet they are incomparably more closely related to each other\r\nthan they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly\r\nthe same climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the\r\ninhabitants of the sea.\r\n\r\nA second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that\r\nbarriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a\r\nclose and important manner to the differences between the productions of\r\nvarious regions. We see this in the great difference in nearly all the\r\nterrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the\r\nnorthern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly\r\ndifferent climate, there might have been free migration for the northern\r\ntemperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions.\r\nWe see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of\r\nAustralia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude; for these\r\ncountries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On\r\neach continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of\r\nlofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts and even of\r\nlarge rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain chains,\r\ndeserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long,\r\nas the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior\r\nin degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.\r\n\r\nTurning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants of\r\nthe eastern and western shores of South America are very distinct, with\r\nextremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in common; but Dr.\r\nGunther has recently shown that about thirty per cent of the fishes are\r\nthe same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of Panama; and this fact\r\nhas led naturalists to believe that the isthmus was formerly open.\r\nWestward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends,\r\nwith not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a\r\nbarrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the\r\neastern islands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna.\r\nSo that three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel\r\nlines not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from\r\nbeing separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of\r\nland or open sea, they are almost wholly distinct. On the other hand,\r\nproceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the\r\ntropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and\r\nwe have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts,\r\nuntil, after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of\r\nAfrica; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and\r\ndistinct marine faunas. Although so few marine animals are common to the\r\nabove-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and\r\nthe eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific into\r\nthe Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of\r\nthe Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposite\r\nmeridians of longitude.\r\n\r\nA third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is the\r\naffinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea,\r\nthough the species themselves are distinct at different points and\r\nstations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent\r\noffers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the naturalist, in\r\ntravelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be\r\nstruck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically\r\ndistinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He hears from\r\nclosely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and\r\nsees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs\r\ncoloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of\r\nMagellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and\r\nnorthward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus;\r\nand not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and\r\nAustralia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we\r\nsee the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as\r\nour hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but\r\nthey plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty\r\npeaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we\r\nlook to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the\r\ncoypu and capybara, rodents of the South American type. Innumerable\r\nother instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the\r\nAmerican shore, however much they may differ in geological structure,\r\nthe inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all\r\npeculiar species. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last\r\nchapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American\r\ncontinent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep\r\norganic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and\r\nwater, independently of physical conditions. The naturalist must be dull\r\nwho is not led to inquire what this bond is.\r\n\r\nThe bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we\r\npositively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we\r\nsee in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The dissimilarity of the\r\ninhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification\r\nthrough variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate\r\ndegree to the definite influence of different physical conditions.\r\nThe degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more\r\ndominant forms of life from one region into another having been more\r\nor less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote--on the\r\nnature and number of the former immigrants--and on the action of the\r\ninhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different\r\nmodifications; the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for\r\nlife being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of\r\nall relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by\r\nchecking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification\r\nthrough natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in\r\nindividuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their\r\nown widely-extended homes, will have the best chance of seizing on new\r\nplaces, when they spread out into new countries. In their new homes they\r\nwill be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further\r\nmodification and improvement; and thus they will become still further\r\nvictorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this\r\nprinciple of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is\r\nthat sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined\r\nto the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the\r\nexistence of any law of necessary development. As the variability of\r\neach species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of\r\nby natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its\r\ncomplex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different\r\nspecies will be no uniform quantity. If a number of species, after\r\nhaving long competed with each other in their old home, were to migrate\r\nin a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they would be\r\nlittle liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in\r\nthemselves effect anything. These principles come into play only by\r\nbringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser\r\ndegree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the\r\nlast chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character\r\nfrom an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have\r\nmigrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at all\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nAccording to these views, it is obvious that the several species of the\r\nsame genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world,\r\nmust originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are\r\ndescended from the same progenitor. In the case of those species which\r\nhave undergone, during whole geological periods, little modification,\r\nthere is not much difficulty in believing that they have migrated from\r\nthe same region; for during the vast geographical and climatical\r\nchanges which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of\r\nmigration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have\r\nreason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within\r\ncomparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It\r\nis also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now\r\ninhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from\r\none spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as has been\r\nexplained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should\r\nhave been produced from parents specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nSINGLE CENTRES OF SUPPOSED CREATION.\r\n\r\nWe are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by\r\nnaturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more\r\npoints of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly there are many cases of\r\nextreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly\r\nhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated\r\npoints, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that\r\neach species was first produced within a single region captivates the\r\nmind. He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation\r\nwith subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is\r\nuniversally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species\r\nis continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two points so\r\ndistant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the\r\nspace could not have been easily passed over by migration, the fact\r\nis given as something remarkable and exceptional. The incapacity of\r\nmigrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case of terrestrial\r\nmammals than perhaps with any other organic beings; and, accordingly,\r\nwe find no inexplicable instances of the same mammals inhabiting distant\r\npoints of the world. No geologist feels any difficulty in Great Britain\r\npossessing the same quadrupeds with the rest of Europe, for they were\r\nno doubt once united. But if the same species can be produced at two\r\nseparate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and\r\nAustralia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the\r\nsame, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become\r\nnaturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants\r\nare identically the same at these distant points of the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have\r\nnot been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means\r\nof dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broken interspaces. The\r\ngreat and striking influence of barriers of all kinds, is intelligible\r\nonly on the view that the great majority of species have been produced\r\non one side, and have not been able to migrate to the opposite side.\r\nSome few families, many subfamilies, very many genera, a still greater\r\nnumber of sections of genera, are confined to a single region; and it\r\nhas been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera,\r\nor those genera in which the species are most closely related to each\r\nother, are generally confined to the same country, or if they have a\r\nwide range that their range is continuous. What a strange anomaly it\r\nwould be if a directly opposite rule were to prevail when we go down one\r\nstep lower in the series, namely to the individuals of the same species,\r\nand these had not been, at least at first, confined to some one region!\r\n\r\nHence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the\r\nview of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having\r\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration\r\nand subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most\r\nprobable. Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how\r\nthe same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the\r\ngeographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred within\r\nrecent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerly\r\ncontinuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to consider\r\nwhether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous, and of so\r\ngrave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable\r\nby general considerations, that each species has been produced within\r\none area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be\r\nhopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\r\nspecies, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a\r\nmoment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances.\r\nBut, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most\r\nstriking classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species\r\non the summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the\r\nArctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),\r\nthe wide distribution of fresh water productions; and thirdly, the\r\noccurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the nearest\r\nmainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the\r\nexistence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the\r\nearth's surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each\r\nspecies having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our\r\nignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes,\r\nand to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a\r\nsingle birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to\r\nconsider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several\r\nspecies of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a\r\ncommon progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during\r\ntheir migration from some one area. If, when most of the species\r\ninhabiting one region are different from those of another region, though\r\nclosely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the one\r\nregion to the other has probably occurred at some former period, our\r\ngeneral view will be much strengthened; for the explanation is obvious\r\non the principle of descent with modification. A volcanic island, for\r\ninstance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles\r\nfrom a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time\r\na few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be\r\nrelated by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent. Cases of\r\nthis nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see, inexplicable\r\non the theory of independent creation. This view of the relation of the\r\nspecies of one region to those of another, does not differ much from\r\nthat advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes that \"every species has come\r\ninto existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing\r\nclosely allied species.\" And it is now well known that he attributes\r\nthis coincidence to descent with modification.\r\n\r\nThe question of single or multiple centres of creation differs from\r\nanother though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals\r\nof the same species are descended from a single pair, or single\r\nhermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many\r\nindividuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never\r\nintercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a\r\nsuccession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other,\r\nbut have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same\r\nspecies, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the\r\nindividuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.\r\nBut in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which\r\nhabitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the\r\nindividuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept\r\nnearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on\r\nsimultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each\r\nstage will not be due to descent from a single parent. To illustrate\r\nwhat I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every\r\nother breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to\r\ndescent from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting and\r\ntraining of many individuals during each generation.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as\r\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of \"single\r\ncentres of creation,\" I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.\r\n\r\nMEANS OF DISPERSAL.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can\r\ngive here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change\r\nof climate must have had a powerful influence on migration. A region now\r\nimpassable to certain organisms from the nature of its climate, might\r\nhave been a high road for migration, when the climate was different. I\r\nshall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject\r\nin some detail. Changes of level in the land must also have been highly\r\ninfluential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge\r\nit, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now\r\nblend together, or may formerly have blended. Where the sea now extends,\r\nland may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even\r\ncontinents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to\r\npass from one to the other. No geologist disputes that great mutations\r\nof level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. Edward\r\nForbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been\r\nrecently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with\r\nAmerica. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every\r\nocean, and united almost every island with some mainland. If, indeed,\r\nthe arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that\r\nscarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to\r\nsome continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the\r\nsame species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty;\r\nbut to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such\r\nenormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. It\r\nseems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations in the\r\nlevel of the land or sea; but not of such vast changes in the position\r\nand extension of our continents, as to have united them within the\r\nrecent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic\r\nislands. I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried\r\nbeneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and\r\nfor many animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans\r\nsuch sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing\r\nover them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that\r\neach species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in\r\nthe course of time we know something definite about the means of\r\ndistribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the\r\nformer extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever be\r\nproved that within the recent period most of our continents which now\r\nstand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously\r\nunited with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands.\r\nSeveral facts in distribution--such as the great difference in the\r\nmarine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent--the close\r\nrelation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to\r\ntheir present inhabitants--the degree of affinity between the mammals\r\ninhabiting islands with those of the nearest continent, being in part\r\ndetermined (as we shall hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening\r\nocean--these and other such facts are opposed to the admission of such\r\nprodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are\r\nnecessary on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers.\r\nThe nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic\r\nislands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former continuity of\r\ncontinents. Nor does the almost universally volcanic composition of\r\nsuch islands favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken\r\ncontinents; if they had originally existed as continental mountain\r\nranges, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other\r\nmountain summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and\r\nother rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.\r\n\r\nI must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but\r\nwhich more properly should be called occasional means of distribution.\r\nI shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that\r\nplant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but the\r\ngreater or less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to\r\nbe almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a\r\nfew experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist\r\nthe injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out\r\nof eighty-seven kinds, sixty-four germinated after an immersion of\r\ntwenty-eight days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. It\r\ndeserves notice that certain orders were far more injured than others:\r\nnine Leguminosae were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the\r\nsalt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceae\r\nand Polemoniaceae, were all killed by a month's immersion. For\r\nconvenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules or\r\nfruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not have been\r\nfloated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured\r\nby salt water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc.,\r\nand some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a\r\ndifference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it\r\noccurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea dried plants or\r\nbranches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them. Hence I was led\r\nto dry the stems and branches of ninety-four plants with ripe fruit, and\r\nto place them on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but some which,\r\nwhilst green, floated for a very short time, when dried floated much\r\nlonger; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried\r\nthey floated for ninety days, and afterwards when planted germinated;\r\nan asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for twenty-three days,\r\nwhen dried it floated for eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards\r\ngerminated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when\r\ndried they floated for above ninety days, and afterwards germinated.\r\nAltogether, out of the ninety-four dried plants, eighteen floated for\r\nabove twenty-eight days; and some of the eighteen floated for a very\r\nmuch longer period. So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds germinated after an\r\nimmersion of twenty-eight days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe\r\nfruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment)\r\nfloated, after being dried, for above twenty-eight days, we may\r\nconclude, as far as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts,\r\nthat the seeds of 14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated\r\nby sea-currents during twenty-eight days, and would retain their power\r\nof germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the\r\nseveral Atlantic currents is thirty-three miles per diem (some currents\r\nrunning at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this average, the seeds\r\nof 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924\r\nmiles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown by an\r\ninland gale to a favourable spot, would germinate.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a\r\nmuch better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,\r\nso that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really\r\nfloating plants. He tried ninety-eight seeds, mostly different from\r\nmine, but he chose many large fruits, and likewise seeds, from plants\r\nwhich live near the sea; and this would have favoured both the average\r\nlength of their flotation and their resistance to the injurious action\r\nof the salt-water. On the other hand, he did not previously dry the\r\nplants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have\r\ncaused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that\r\n18/98 of his seeds of different kinds floated for forty-two days, and\r\nwere then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed\r\nto the waves would float for a less time than those protected from\r\nviolent movement as in our experiments. Therefore, it would perhaps be\r\nsafer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after\r\nhaving been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in\r\nwidth, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often\r\nfloating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large\r\nseeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have\r\nrestricted ranges, could hardly be transported by any other means.\r\n\r\nSeeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber\r\nis thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest\r\noceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure\r\nstones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these\r\nstones being a valuable royal tax. I find that when irregularly shaped\r\nstones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth\r\nare very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them, so\r\nperfectly that not a particle could be washed away during the longest\r\ntransport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY enclosed by\r\nthe roots of an oak about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous plants\r\ngerminated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again,\r\nI can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea,\r\nsometimes escape being immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds\r\nin the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and\r\nvetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in\r\nsea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated\r\non artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly all\r\ngerminated.\r\n\r\nLiving birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\r\ntransportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently\r\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the\r\nocean. We may safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of\r\nflight would often be thirty-five miles an hour; and some authors have\r\ngiven a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious\r\nseeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit\r\npass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the\r\ncourse of two months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds,\r\nout of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some\r\nof them, which were tried, germinated. But the following fact is more\r\nimportant: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not,\r\nas I know by trial, injure in the least the germination of seeds;\r\nnow, after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is\r\npositively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for\r\ntwelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in this interval might easily be\r\nblown to the distance of five hundred miles, and hawks are known to look\r\nout for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus\r\nreadily get scattered. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and\r\nafter an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets,\r\nwhich, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens,\r\ninclude seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat,\r\nmillet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from\r\ntwelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey;\r\nand two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days\r\nand fourteen hours. Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and\r\nwater plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds\r\nmight be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of\r\nseeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to\r\nfishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of\r\nmany hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their\r\nexcrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination.\r\nCertain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.\r\n\r\nLocusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land. I myself\r\ncaught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard of others\r\ncaught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe informed Sir C. Lyell\r\nthat in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira.\r\nThey were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow in the\r\nheaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen with a\r\ntelescope. During two or three days they slowly careered round and round\r\nin an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at\r\nnight alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with\r\nthem. They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had\r\nappeared, and have not since visited the island. Now, in parts of Natal\r\nit is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient evidence, that\r\ninjurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land in the dung left\r\nby the great flights of locusts which often visit that country. In\r\nconsequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a letter a small packet\r\nof the dried pellets, out of which I extracted under the microscope\r\nseveral seeds, and raised from them seven grass plants, belonging to\r\ntwo species, of two genera. Hence a swarm of locusts, such as that which\r\nvisited Madeira, might readily be the means of introducing several kinds\r\nof plants into an island lying far from the mainland.\r\n\r\nAlthough the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth\r\nsometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and\r\nin another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the\r\nfoot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the\r\nseed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent\r\nto me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the\r\nshank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of\r\nthe toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr.\r\nSwaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close\r\nattention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot\r\nwagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their\r\nfirst arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has\r\nseveral times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many\r\nfacts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds.\r\nFor instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge\r\n(Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of\r\nhard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth\r\nhad been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed\r\nunder a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these\r\nconsisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at\r\nleast one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted,\r\njudging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species.\r\nWith such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are\r\nannually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which\r\nannually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the\r\nMediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in\r\ndirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAs icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and\r\nhave even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it can\r\nhardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell,\r\nhave transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and\r\nantarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the\r\nnow temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number\r\nof plants common to Europe, in comparison with the species on the other\r\nislands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as\r\nremarked by Mr. H.C. Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in\r\ncomparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been\r\npartly stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch. At my\r\nrequest Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had\r\nobserved erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had\r\nfound large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in\r\nthe archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed\r\ntheir rocky burdens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it\r\nis at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of\r\nnorthern plants.\r\n\r\nConsidering that these several means of transport, and that other means,\r\nwhich without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year\r\nafter year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a\r\nmarvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.\r\nThese means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is\r\nnot strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor\r\nis the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed\r\nthat scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great\r\ndistances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a\r\ngreat length of time to the action of sea water; nor could they be long\r\ncarried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would\r\nsuffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred\r\nmiles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a\r\nneighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. The\r\nfloras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled;\r\nbut would remain as distinct as they now are. The currents, from their\r\ncourse, would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though\r\nthey might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western\r\nshores, where, if not killed by their very long immersion in salt\r\nwater, they could not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two\r\nland-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North\r\nAmerica to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be\r\ntransported by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt\r\nadhering to their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident.\r\nEven in this case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on\r\nfavourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error\r\nto argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has\r\nnot, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this),\r\nreceived within the last few centuries, through occasional means\r\nof transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a\r\npoorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland,\r\nwould not receive colonists by similar means. Out of a hundred kinds of\r\nseeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked\r\nthan Britain, perhaps not more than one would be so well fitted to\r\nits new home, as to become naturalised. But this is no valid argument\r\nagainst what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during\r\nthe long lapse of geological time, whilst the island was being upheaved,\r\nand before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare\r\nland, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly\r\nevery seed which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would\r\ngerminate and survive.\r\n\r\nDISPERSAL DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated\r\nfrom each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where Alpine species\r\ncould not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the\r\nsame species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility\r\nof their having migrated from one point to the other. It is indeed a\r\nremarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species living on the\r\nsnowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts\r\nof Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White\r\nMountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those\r\nof Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with\r\nthose on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as 1747,\r\nsuch facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have\r\nbeen independently created at many distinct points; and we might have\r\nremained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid\r\nattention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,\r\naffords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost\r\nevery conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that, within a very\r\nrecent geological period, central Europe and North America suffered\r\nunder an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell\r\ntheir tale more plainly than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales,\r\nwith their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of\r\nthe icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly\r\nhas the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic\r\nmoraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize.\r\nThroughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders and\r\nscored rocks plainly reveal a former cold period.\r\n\r\nThe former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\r\ninhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is substantially\r\nas follows. But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing\r\na new glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly\r\noccurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became\r\nfitted for the inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of\r\nthe former inhabitants of the temperate regions. The latter, at the\r\nsame time would travel further and further southward, unless they were\r\nstopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains\r\nwould become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine\r\ninhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had\r\nreached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora, covering\r\nthe central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees,\r\nand even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United\r\nStates would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and\r\nthese would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present\r\ncircumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled\r\nsouthward, are remarkably uniform round the world.\r\n\r\nAs the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,\r\nclosely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more\r\ntemperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the\r\nmountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed\r\nground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still\r\nfurther disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were\r\npursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully\r\nreturned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the\r\nEuropean and North American lowlands, would again be found in the arctic\r\nregions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated mountain-summits\r\nfar distant from each other.\r\n\r\nThus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so\r\nimmensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of\r\nEurope. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants\r\nof each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms\r\nliving due north or nearly due north of them: for the first migration\r\nwhen the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth,\r\nwould generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for\r\nexample, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson, and those of\r\nthe Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the\r\nplants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador;\r\nthose of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country.\r\nThese views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained\r\noccurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so\r\nsatisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic\r\nproductions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find\r\nthe same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude,\r\nwithout other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their\r\nmigration across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAs the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to\r\nthe north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have\r\nbeen exposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of\r\ntemperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual\r\nrelations will not have been much disturbed. Hence, in accordance with\r\nthe principles inculcated in this volume, these forms will not have\r\nbeen liable to much modification. But with the Alpine productions, left\r\nisolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases\r\nand ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have\r\nbeen somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic\r\nspecies will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each\r\nother, and have survived there ever since; they will also, in all\r\nprobability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must\r\nhave existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial\r\nepoch, and which during the coldest period will have been temporarily\r\ndriven down to the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently\r\nexposed to somewhat different climatical influences. Their mutual\r\nrelations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently\r\nthey will have been liable to modification; and they have been modified;\r\nfor if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several\r\ngreat European mountain ranges, one with another, though many of the\r\nspecies remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some as\r\ndoubtful forms or sub-species and some as distinct yet closely allied\r\nspecies representing each other on the several ranges.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the commencement\r\nof our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform\r\nround the polar regions as they are at the present day. But it is also\r\nnecessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms\r\nwere the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist\r\non the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and\r\nEurope are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree\r\nof uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world,\r\nat the commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day, the\r\nsub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds\r\nare separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the\r\nnorthern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the\r\ninhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they\r\ndo at present, they must have been still more completely separated from\r\neach other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked\r\nhow the same species could then or previously have entered the two\r\ncontinents. The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the\r\nclimate before the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the\r\nnewer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were\r\nspecifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that\r\nthe climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may suppose\r\nthat the organisms which now live under latitude 60 degrees, lived\r\nduring the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in\r\nlatitude 66-67 degrees; and that the present arctic productions then\r\nlived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we look at\r\na terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost\r\ncontinuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern America.\r\nAnd this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom\r\nunder a more favourable climate for intermigration, will account for the\r\nsupposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate productions of the\r\nOld and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nBelieving, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long\r\nremained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to great\r\noscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view,\r\nand to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as\r\nthe older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals\r\ninhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants\r\nand animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate\r\nsouthwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement\r\nof the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants,\r\nmostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the\r\nUnited States. On this view we can understand the relationship with very\r\nlittle identity, between the productions of North America and Europe--a\r\nrelationship which is highly remarkable, considering the distance of\r\nthe two areas, and their separation by the whole Atlantic Ocean. We can\r\nfurther understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers\r\nthat the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary\r\nstages were more closely related to each other than they are at the\r\npresent time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the\r\nOld and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by\r\nland, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the\r\nintermigration of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDuring the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as\r\nthe species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated\r\nsouth of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from\r\neach other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions\r\nare concerned, must have taken place long ages ago. As the plants and\r\nanimals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one\r\ngreat region with the native American productions, and would have had to\r\ncompete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the\r\nOld World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for\r\nmuch modification--for far more modification than with the Alpine\r\nproductions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the\r\nseveral mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and North\r\nAmerica. Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now living\r\nproductions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find\r\nvery few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more\r\nplants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every\r\ngreat class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical\r\nraces, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or\r\nrepresentative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nAs on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration\r\nof a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier\r\nperiod, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar\r\nCircle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely\r\nallied forms now living in marine areas completely sundered. Thus, I\r\nthink, we can understand the presence of some closely allied, still\r\nexisting and extinct tertiary forms, on the eastern and western shores\r\nof temperate North America; and the still more striking fact of many\r\nclosely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), some\r\nfish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the seas\r\nof Japan--these two areas being now completely separated by the breadth\r\nof a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.\r\n\r\nThese cases of close relationship in species either now or formerly\r\ninhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of North America,\r\nthe Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands of North America\r\nand Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation. We cannot\r\nmaintain that such species have been created alike, in correspondence\r\nwith the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we\r\ncompare, for instance, certain parts of South America with parts of\r\nSouth Africa or Australia, we see countries closely similar in all their\r\nphysical conditions, with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.\r\n\r\nALTERNATE GLACIAL PERIODS IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced that\r\nForbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the\r\nplainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of\r\nBritain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer\r\nfrom the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that\r\nSiberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to Dr. Hooker,\r\nperpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and fed glaciers which\r\nrolled 4,000 feet down the valleys. The same observer has recently found\r\ngreat moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in North Africa. Along\r\nthe Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of\r\ntheir former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing\r\non ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of the Asiatic continent, on\r\nthe opposite side of the equator, we know, from the excellent researches\r\nof Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in New Zealand immense glaciers\r\nformerly descended to a low level; and the same plants, found by Dr.\r\nHooker on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story\r\nof a former cold period. From facts communicated to me by the Rev. W.B.\r\nClarke, it appears also that there are traces of former glacial action\r\non the mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.\r\n\r\nLooking to America: in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock\r\nhave been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as far south as\r\nlatitude 36 and 37 degrees, and on the shores of the Pacific, where\r\nthe climate is now so different, as far south as latitude 46 degrees.\r\nErratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In\r\nthe Cordillera of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once\r\nextended far below their present level. In central Chile I examined\r\na vast mound of detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo\r\nvalley, which, there can hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine;\r\nand Mr. D. Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the\r\nCordillera, from latitude 13 to 30 degrees south, at about the height of\r\n12,000 feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was\r\nfamiliar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including\r\ngrooved pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers\r\ndo not now exist even at much more considerable heights. Further\r\nsouth, on both sides of the continent, from latitude 41 degrees to the\r\nsouthernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial\r\naction, in numerous immense boulders transported far from their parent\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having\r\nextended all round the northern and southern hemispheres--from\r\nthe period having been in a geological sense recent in both\r\nhemispheres--from its having lasted in both during a great length of\r\ntime, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected--and lastly,\r\nfrom glaciers having recently descended to a low level along the whole\r\nline of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not\r\navoid the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been\r\nsimultaneously lowered during the Glacial period. But now, Mr. Croll,\r\nin a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial\r\ncondition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought\r\ninto operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.\r\nAll these causes tend towards the same end; but the most powerful\r\nappears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit\r\nupon oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly\r\nrecur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals\r\nare extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the most\r\nimportant, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relative position of the\r\nland and water. Mr. Croll believes that the last great glacial period\r\noccurred about 240,000 years ago, and endured, with slight alterations\r\nof climate, for about 160,000 years. With respect to more ancient\r\nglacial periods, several geologists are convinced, from direct evidence,\r\nthat such occurred during the miocene and eocene formations, not to\r\nmention still more ancient formations. But the most important result for\r\nus, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere\r\npasses through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere\r\nis actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly\r\nthrough changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So conversely it\r\nwill be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern passes through\r\na glacial period. This conclusion throws so much light on geographical\r\ndistribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in it; but I will\r\nfirst give the facts which demand an explanation.\r\n\r\nIn South America, Dr. Hooker has shown that besides many closely allied\r\nspecies, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra del\r\nFuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common to\r\nNorth America and Europe, enormously remote as these areas in opposite\r\nhemispheres are from each other. On the lofty mountains of equatorial\r\nAmerica a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur.\r\nOn the Organ Mountains of Brazil some few temperate European, some\r\nAntarctic and some Andean genera were found by Gardner which do not\r\nexist in the low intervening hot countries. On the Silla of Caraccas\r\nthe illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera\r\ncharacteristic of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe, and some few\r\nrepresentatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur on the\r\nmountains of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European\r\nspecies, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the\r\nmountains several representative European forms are found which have\r\nnot been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. Dr. Hooker has\r\nalso lately shown that several of the plants living on the upper parts\r\nof the lofty island of Fernando Po, and on the neighbouring Cameroon\r\nMountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those on the\r\nmountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate Europe. It\r\nnow also appears, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, that some of these same\r\ntemperate plants have been discovered by the Rev. R.T. Lowe on the\r\nmountains of the Cape Verde Islands. This extension of the same\r\ntemperate forms, almost under the equator, across the whole continent of\r\nAfrica and to the mountains of the Cape Verde archipelago, is one of the\r\nmost astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula of\r\nIndia, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many\r\nplants occur either identically the same or representing each other,\r\nand at the same time representing plants of Europe not found in the\r\nintervening hot lowlands. A list of the genera of plants collected on\r\nthe loftier peaks of Java, raises a picture of a collection made on\r\na hillock in Europe. Still more striking is the fact that peculiar\r\nAustralian forms are represented by certain plants growing on the\r\nsummits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as\r\nI hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of\r\nMalacca, and are thinly scattered on the one hand over India, and on the\r\nother hand as far north as Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Muller has discovered\r\nseveral European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur\r\non the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by\r\nDr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the\r\nintermediate torrid regions. In the admirable \"Introduction to the Flora\r\nof New Zealand,\" by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given\r\nin regard to the plants of that large island. Hence, we see that certain\r\nplants growing on the more lofty mountains of the tropics in all parts\r\nof the world, and on the temperate plains of the north and south, are\r\neither the same species or varieties of the same species. It should,\r\nhowever, be observed that these plants are not strictly arctic forms;\r\nfor, as Mr. H.C. Watson has remarked, \"in receding from polar toward\r\nequatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain flora really become less\r\nand less Arctic.\" Besides these identical and closely allied forms, many\r\nspecies inhabiting the same widely sundered areas, belong to genera not\r\nnow found in the intermediate tropical lowlands.\r\n\r\nThese brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few analogous facts\r\ncould be given in regard to terrestrial animals. In marine productions,\r\nsimilar cases likewise occur; as an example, I may quote a statement\r\nby the highest authority, Prof. Dana, that \"it is certainly a wonderful\r\nfact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea\r\nto Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.\"\r\nSir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New\r\nZealand, Tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs\r\nme that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to\r\nEurope, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate forms\r\non the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the\r\nPeninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less\r\nwell-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South America, it\r\nappears almost certain that at some former period, no doubt during\r\nthe most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great\r\ncontinents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by a considerable\r\nnumber of temperate forms. At this period the equatorial climate at the\r\nlevel of the sea was probably about the same with that now experienced\r\nat the height of from five to six thousand feet under the same latitude,\r\nor perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest period, the\r\nlowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled\r\ntropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as\r\ngrowing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet\r\non the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater\r\npreponderance of temperate forms. So again in the mountainous island of\r\nFernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European\r\nforms beginning to appear at the height of about five thousand feet. On\r\nthe mountains of Panama, at the height of only two thousand feet, Dr.\r\nSeemann found the vegetation like that of Mexico, \"with forms of the\r\ntorrid zone harmoniously blended with those of the temperate.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us see whether Mr. Croll's conclusion that when the northern\r\nhemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period,\r\nthe southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on\r\nthe present apparently inexplicable distribution of various organisms\r\nin the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the mountains of the\r\ntropics. The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very\r\nlong; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants\r\nand animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have\r\nbeen ample for any amount of migration. As the cold became more and more\r\nintense, we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and\r\nfrom the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the\r\nmore vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the\r\nequatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at the\r\nsame time have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the\r\nsouth, for the southern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On the\r\ndecline of the Glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered\r\ntheir former temperature, the northern temperate forms living on the\r\nlowlands under the equator, would have been driven to their former homes\r\nor have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning\r\nfrom the south. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would\r\nalmost certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if\r\nsufficiently lofty, they would have long survived like the Arctic\r\nforms on the mountains of Europe. They might have survived, even if the\r\nclimate was not perfectly fitted for them, for the change of temperature\r\nmust have been very slow, and plants undoubtedly possess a certain\r\ncapacity for acclimatisation, as shown by their transmitting to their\r\noffspring different constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIn the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in\r\nits turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern\r\nhemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms would\r\ninvade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had before been\r\nleft on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the southern\r\nforms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return to their\r\nformer homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and carrying\r\nsouthward with them some of the northern temperate forms which had\r\ndescended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus, we should have some\r\nfew species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions. But\r\nthe species left during a long time on these mountains, or in opposite\r\nhemispheres, would have to compete with many new forms and would be\r\nexposed to somewhat different physical conditions; hence, they would\r\nbe eminently liable to modification, and would generally now exist as\r\nvarieties or as representative species; and this is the case. We must,\r\nalso, bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial\r\nperiods; for these will account, in accordance with the same principles,\r\nfor the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same widely separated\r\nareas, and belonging to genera not now found in the intermediate torrid\r\nzones.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to\r\nAmerica, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more\r\nidentical or slightly modified species have migrated from the north to\r\nthe south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern\r\nforms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this\r\npreponderant migration from the north to the south is due to the greater\r\nextent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed\r\nin their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been\r\nadvanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of\r\nperfection, or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when\r\nthe two sets became commingled in the equatorial regions, during the\r\nalternations of the Glacial periods, the northern forms were the more\r\npowerful and were able to hold their places on the mountains, and\r\nafterwards migrate southward with the southern forms; but not so the\r\nsouthern in regard to the northern forms. In the same manner, at the\r\npresent day, we see that very many European productions cover the ground\r\nin La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser degree in Australia, and have\r\nbeaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become\r\nnaturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere, though hides, wool,\r\nand other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into\r\nEurope during the last two or three centuries from La Plata and during\r\nthe last forty or fifty years from Australia. The Neilgherrie Mountains\r\nin India, however, offer a partial exception; for here, as I hear from\r\nDr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly sowing themselves and becoming\r\nnaturalised. Before the last great Glacial period, no doubt the\r\nintertropical mountains were stocked with endemic Alpine forms;\r\nbut these have almost everywhere yielded to the more dominant forms\r\ngenerated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north.\r\nIn many islands the native productions are nearly equalled, or even\r\noutnumbered, by those which have become naturalised; and this is the\r\nfirst stage towards their extinction. Mountains are islands on the land;\r\nand their inhabitants have yielded to those produced within the larger\r\nareas of the north, just in the same way as the inhabitants of real\r\nislands have everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental\r\nforms naturalised through man's agency.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals and\r\nof marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate zones, and\r\non the intertropical mountains. When, during the height of the Glacial\r\nperiod, the ocean-currents were widely different to what they now are,\r\nsome of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might have reached\r\nthe equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able to migrate\r\nsouthwards, by keeping to the cooler currents, while others might remain\r\nand survive in the colder depths until the southern hemisphere was in\r\nits turn subjected to a glacial climate and permitted their further\r\nprogress; in nearly the same manner as, according to Forbes, isolated\r\nspaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the present day in the\r\ndeeper parts of the northern temperate seas.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to the\r\ndistribution and affinities of the identical and allied species, which\r\nnow live so widely separated in the north and south, and sometimes on\r\nthe intermediate mountain ranges, are removed on the views above given.\r\nThe exact lines of migration cannot be indicated. We cannot say why\r\ncertain species and not others have migrated; why certain species\r\nhave been modified and have given rise to new forms, while others have\r\nremained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can\r\nsay why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency\r\nin a foreign land; why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and is\r\ntwice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.\r\n\r\nVarious special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance,\r\nthe occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points\r\nso enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but\r\nicebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their\r\ndispersal. The existence at these and other distant points of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to\r\ngenera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case.\r\nSome of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there\r\nhas been time since the commencement of the last Glacial period for\r\ntheir migration and subsequent modification to the necessary degree.\r\nThe facts seem to indicate that distinct species belonging to the same\r\ngenera have migrated in radiating lines from a common centre; and I am\r\ninclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a\r\nformer and warmer period, before the commencement of the last Glacial\r\nperiod, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a\r\nhighly peculiar and isolated flora. It may be suspected that before this\r\nflora was exterminated during the last Glacial epoch, a few forms\r\nhad been already widely dispersed to various points of the southern\r\nhemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as\r\nhalting-places, of now sunken islands. Thus the southern shores of\r\nAmerica, Australia, and New Zealand may have become slightly tinted by\r\nthe same peculiar forms of life.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost\r\nidentical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate\r\nthroughout the world on geographical distribution. And we have now seen\r\nthat Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the one\r\nhemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere,\r\ntogether with the admission of the slow modification of species,\r\nexplains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of the\r\nallied forms of life in all parts of the globe. The living waters have\r\nflowed during one period from the north and during another from the\r\nsouth, and in both cases have reached the equator; but the stream of\r\nlife has flowed with greater force from the north than in the opposite\r\ndirection, and has consequently more freely inundated the south. As the\r\ntide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores\r\nwhere the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their\r\nliving drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from\r\nthe Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator. The various\r\nbeings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man,\r\ndriven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every\r\nland, which serves as a record, full of interest to us, of the former\r\ninhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

When first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I well\r\nremember feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water\r\ninsects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding\r\nterrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.\r\n\r\nBut the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think,\r\nin most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner\r\nhighly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond\r\nto pond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries; and\r\nliability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost\r\nnecessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases; of these,\r\nsome of the most difficult to explain are presented by fish. It was\r\nformerly believed that the same fresh-water species never existed on\r\ntwo continents distant from each other. But Dr. Gunther has lately\r\nshown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the\r\nFalkland Islands and the mainland of South America. This is a wonderful\r\ncase, and probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during a\r\nformer warm period. This case, however, is rendered in some degree less\r\nsurprising by the species of this genus having the power of crossing by\r\nsome unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean: thus there is\r\none species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands, though\r\nseparated by a distance of about 230 miles. On the same continent\r\nfresh-water fish often range widely, and as if capriciously; for in two\r\nadjoining river systems some of the species may be the same and some\r\nwholly different.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be\r\ncalled accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely\r\ndropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the ova\r\nretain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the\r\nwater. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in\r\nthe level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow\r\ninto each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred\r\nduring floods, without any change of level. The wide differences of the\r\nfish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous\r\nand consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented\r\nthe inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the\r\nsame conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms,\r\nand in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical\r\nchanges, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover,\r\nDr. Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer\r\nthat with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. Salt-water\r\nfish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and,\r\naccording to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which\r\nall the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species\r\nbelonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores\r\nof the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted without much\r\ndifficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.\r\n\r\nSome species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied\r\nspecies which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent, and\r\nmust have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world.\r\nTheir distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not\r\nlikely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the adults,\r\nare immediately killed by sea-water. I could not even understand\r\nhow some naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout the same\r\ncountry. But two facts, which I have observed--and many others no\r\ndoubt will be discovered--throw some light on this subject. When ducks\r\nsuddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen\r\nthese little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me,\r\nin removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have\r\nunintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other.\r\nBut another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a\r\nduck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching;\r\nand I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells\r\ncrawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out\r\nof the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more\r\nadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched\r\nmolluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,\r\nin damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time\r\na duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and\r\nif blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant\r\npoint, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir Charles Lyell\r\ninforms me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water\r\nshell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of\r\nthe same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the \"Beagle,\" when\r\nforty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it\r\nmight have been blown by a favouring gale no one can tell.\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many\r\nfresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over continents and\r\nto the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly illustrated,\r\naccording to Alph. de Candolle, in those large groups of terrestrial\r\nplants, which have very few aquatic members; for the latter seem\r\nimmediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide range. I think\r\nfavourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned\r\nthat earth occasionally adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks\r\nof birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if\r\nsuddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds\r\nof this order wander more than those of any other; and are occasionally\r\nfound on the most remote and barren islands of the open ocean; they\r\nwould not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that any\r\ndirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining the land,\r\nthey would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not\r\nbelieve that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with\r\nseeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only\r\nthe most striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls of mud\r\nfrom three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little\r\npond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 and 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered\r\nup in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it\r\ngrew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number;\r\nand yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering\r\nthese facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if\r\nwater-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to\r\nunstocked ponds and streams, situated at very distant points. The same\r\nagency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller\r\nfresh-water animals.\r\n\r\nOther and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have\r\nstated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject\r\nmany other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow\r\nseeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton.\r\nHerons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily\r\ndevouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are\r\nblown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of\r\ngermination, when rejected many hours afterwards in pellets or in\r\nthe excrement. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine\r\nwater-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks\r\non the distribution of this plant, I thought that the means of its\r\ndispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found\r\nthe seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr.\r\nHooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach. Now this bird must\r\noften have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds,\r\nand, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe\r\nthat it would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state for\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\nIn considering these several means of distribution, it should be\r\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance on a\r\nrising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have\r\na good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle\r\nfor life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however few in kind,\r\nyet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in comparison\r\nwith the number of species inhabiting an equal area of land, the\r\ncompetition between them will probably be less severe than between\r\nterrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a\r\nforeign country would have a better chance of seizing on a new place,\r\nthan in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should also remember that\r\nmany fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and we have\r\nreason to believe that such beings become modified more slowly than the\r\nhigh; and this will give time for the migration of aquatic species.\r\nWe should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms having\r\nformerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having become\r\nextinct at intermediate points. But the wide distribution of fresh-water\r\nplants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical\r\nform, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in main part on the\r\nwide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by\r\nfresh-water birds, which have great powers of flight, and naturally\r\ntravel from one piece of water to another.\r\n\r\nON THE INHABITANTS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have\r\nselected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with respect to\r\ndistribution, on the view that not only all the individuals of the\r\nsame species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species,\r\nalthough now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a\r\nsingle area, the birthplace of their early progenitors. I have already\r\ngiven my reasons for disbelieving in continental extensions within the\r\nperiod of existing species on so enormous a scale that all the many\r\nislands of the several oceans were thus stocked with their present\r\nterrestrial inhabitants. This view removes many difficulties, but it\r\ndoes not accord with all the facts in regard to the productions of\r\nislands. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere\r\nquestion of dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on\r\nthe truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent\r\nwith modification.\r\n\r\nThe species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number\r\ncompared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits\r\nthis for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New Zealand, for instance,\r\nwith its lofty mountains and diversified stations, extending over 780\r\nmiles of latitude, together with the outlying islands of Auckland,\r\nCampbell and Chatham, contain altogether only 960 kinds of flowering\r\nplants; if we compare this moderate number with the species which swarm\r\nover equal areas in Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwe must admit that some cause, independently of different physical\r\nconditions, has given rise to so great a difference in number. Even the\r\nuniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of\r\nAnglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included\r\nin these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite\r\nfair. We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally\r\npossessed less than half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have\r\nnow become naturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every\r\nother oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason\r\nto believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite\r\nexterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of the\r\ncreation of each separate species, will have to admit that a sufficient\r\nnumber of the best adapted plants and animals were not created for\r\noceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them far more fully\r\nand perfectly than did nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the\r\nproportion of endemic kinds (i.e. those found nowhere else in the world)\r\nis often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the number of\r\nendemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare\r\nthe area of the island with that of the continent, we shall see that\r\nthis is true. This fact might have been theoretically expected, for, as\r\nalready explained, species occasionally arriving, after long intervals\r\nof time in the new and isolated district, and having to compete with new\r\nassociates, would be eminently liable to modification, and would often\r\nproduce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means follows that,\r\nbecause in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar,\r\nthose of another class, or of another section of the same class, are\r\npeculiar; and this difference seems to depend partly on the species\r\nwhich are not modified having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual\r\nrelations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent\r\narrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, with which\r\nthe insular forms have intercrossed. It should be borne in mind that the\r\noffspring of such crosses would certainly gain in vigour; so that even\r\nan occasional cross would produce more effect than might have been\r\nanticipated. I will give a few illustrations of the foregoing remarks:\r\nin the Galapagos Islands there are twenty-six land birds; of these\r\ntwenty-one (or perhaps twenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven\r\nmarine birds only two are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds\r\ncould arrive at these islands much more easily and frequently than\r\nland-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same\r\ndistance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South\r\nAmerica, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess a single\r\nendemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.M. Jones's admirable account\r\nof Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally or even\r\nfrequently visit this island. Almost every year, as I am informed by\r\nMr. E.V. Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to Madeira;\r\nthis island is inhabited by ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is\r\npeculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or\r\nfour other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries.\r\nSo that the islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the\r\nneighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there\r\nstruggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted. Hence, when\r\nsettled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others\r\nto its proper place and habits, and will consequently have been but\r\nlittle liable to modification. Any tendency to modification will also\r\nhave been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants,\r\noften arriving from the mother-country. Madeira again is inhabited by\r\na wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species\r\nof sea-shell is peculiar to its shores: now, though we do not know how\r\nsea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae,\r\nperhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading\r\nbirds, might be transported across three or four hundred miles of open\r\nsea far more easily than land-shells. The different orders of insects\r\ninhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.\r\n\r\nOceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain whole\r\nclasses, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in the\r\nGalapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,\r\ntake, or recently took, the place of mammals. Although New Zealand\r\nis here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful\r\nwhether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not\r\nseparated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological\r\ncharacter and the direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B. Clarke\r\nhas lately maintained that this island, as well as New Caledonia, should\r\nbe considered as appurtenances of Australia. Turning to plants, Dr.\r\nHooker has shown that in the Galapagos Islands the proportional numbers\r\nof the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere.\r\nAll such differences in number, and the absence of certain whole\r\ngroups of animals and plants, are generally accounted for by supposed\r\ndifferences in the physical conditions of the islands; but this\r\nexplanation is not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration seems to\r\nhave been fully as important as the nature of the conditions.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the\r\ninhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands not\r\ntenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have beautifully\r\nhooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than that hooks serve\r\nfor the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of quadrupeds. But a\r\nhooked seed might be carried to an island by other means; and the plant\r\nthen becoming modified would form an endemic species, still retaining\r\nits hooks, which would form a useless appendage, like the shrivelled\r\nwings under the soldered wing-covers of many insular beetles. Again,\r\nislands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which\r\nelsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de\r\nCandolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined\r\nranges. Hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic\r\nislands; and an herbaceous plant, which had no chance of successfully\r\ncompeting with the many fully developed trees growing on a continent,\r\nmight, when established on an island, gain an advantage over other\r\nherbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping them.\r\nIn this case, natural selection would tend to add to the stature of the\r\nplant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first convert it into a\r\nbush and then into a tree.\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF BATRACHIANS AND TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS ON OCEANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic\r\nislands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs,\r\ntoads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which the\r\ngreat oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion,\r\nand have found it true, with the exception of New Zealand, New\r\nCaledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the\r\nSeychelles. But I have already remarked that it is doubtful whether New\r\nZealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and\r\nthis is still more doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon\r\ngroups and the Seychelles. This general absence of frogs, toads and\r\nnewts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their\r\nphysical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted\r\nfor these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the\r\nAzores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance.\r\nBut as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed (with the\r\nexception, as far as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there\r\nwould be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and\r\ntherefore we can see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands.\r\nBut why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created\r\nthere, it would be very difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nMammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the\r\noldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from doubt,\r\nof a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the\r\nnatives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent\r\nor great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less\r\ndistance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited\r\nby a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot\r\nbe considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the\r\nmainland at a distance of about 280 miles; moreover, icebergs formerly\r\nbrought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly\r\ntransported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions. Yet\r\nit cannot be said that small islands will not support at least small\r\nmammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small\r\nislands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an island can be\r\nnamed on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and\r\ngreatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation,\r\nthat there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic\r\nislands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation\r\nwhich they have suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also\r\nbeen time for the production of endemic species belonging to other\r\nclasses; and on continents it is known that new species of mammals\r\nappear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals.\r\nAlthough terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial\r\nmammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats\r\nfound nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago,\r\nthe Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and\r\nMauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has\r\nthe supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on\r\nremote islands? On my view this question can easily be answered; for no\r\nterrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but\r\nbats can fly across. Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the\r\nAtlantic Ocean; and two North American species, either regularly or\r\noccasionally, visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the\r\nmainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied this family,\r\nthat many species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents\r\nand on far distant islands. Hence, we have only to suppose that such\r\nwandering species have been modified in their new homes in relation to\r\ntheir new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats\r\non oceanic islands, with the absence of all other terrestrial mammals.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the\r\nsea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent,\r\nand the degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants. Mr. Windsor\r\nEarl has made some striking observations on this head, since greatly\r\nextended by Mr. Wallace's admirable researches, in regard to the great\r\nMalay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep\r\nocean, and this separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On\r\neither side, the islands stand on a moderately shallow submarine\r\nbank, and these islands are inhabited by the same or by closely allied\r\nquadrupeds. I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all\r\nquarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds\r\ngood. For instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from\r\nEurope, and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with\r\nall the islands near the shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands,\r\non the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one thousand\r\nfathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and\r\neven the genera are quite distinct. As the amount of modification which\r\nanimals of all kinds undergo partly depends on the lapse of time, and as\r\nthe islands which are separated from each other, or from the mainland,\r\nby shallow channels, are more likely to have been continuously united\r\nwithin a recent period than the islands separated by deeper channels, we\r\ncan understand how it is that a relation exists between the depth of the\r\nsea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity,\r\na relation which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts\r\nof creation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic\r\nislands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large proportion\r\nconsisting of endemic forms--the members of certain groups, but not\r\nthose of other groups in the same class, having been modified--the\r\nabsence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians and of terrestrial\r\nmammals, notwithstanding the presence of aerial bats, the singular\r\nproportions of certain orders of plants, herbaceous forms having been\r\ndeveloped into trees, etc., seem to me to accord better with the belief\r\nin the efficiency of occasional means of transport, carried on during\r\na long course of time, than with the belief in the former connection of\r\nall oceanic islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter\r\nview it is probable that the various classes would have immigrated more\r\nuniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their mutual\r\nrelations would not have been much disturbed, and consequently, they\r\nwould either have not been modified, or all the species in a more\r\nequable manner.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in\r\nunderstanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,\r\nwhether still retaining the same specific form or subsequently modified,\r\nhave reached their present homes. But the probability of other islands\r\nhaving once existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains,\r\nmust not be overlooked. I will specify one difficult case. Almost all\r\noceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited\r\nby land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species\r\nfound elsewhere striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A.A.\r\nGould in relation to the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells\r\nare easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have\r\ntried, sink in it and are killed. Yet there must be some unknown,\r\nbut occasionally efficient means for their transportal. Would the\r\njust-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting on\r\nthe ground and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells,\r\nwhen hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the\r\nshell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately\r\nwide arms of the sea. And I find that several species in this state\r\nwithstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days. One\r\nshell, the Helix pomatia, after having been thus treated, and again\r\nhybernating, was put into sea-water for twenty days and perfectly\r\nrecovered. During this length of time the shell might have been\r\ncarried by a marine country of average swiftness to a distance of 660\r\ngeographical miles. As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum\r\nI removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again\r\nimmersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and\r\ncrawled away. Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments. He\r\nplaced 100 land-shells, belonging to ten species, in a box pierced with\r\nholes, and immersed it for a fortnight in the sea. Out of the hundred\r\nshells twenty-seven recovered. The presence of an operculum seems\r\nto have been of importance, as out of twelve specimens of Cyclostoma\r\nelegans, which is thus furnished, eleven revived. It is remarkable,\r\nseeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted with me the salt-water, that\r\nnot one of fifty-four specimens belonging to four other species of Helix\r\ntried by Aucapitaine recovered. It is, however, not at all probable that\r\nland-shells have often been thus transported; the feet of birds offer a\r\nmore probable method.\r\n\r\nON THE RELATIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OF ISLANDS TO THOSE OF THE NEAREST\r\nMAINLAND.\r\n\r\nThe most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the\r\nspecies which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland,\r\nwithout being actually the same. Numerous instances could be given. The\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a distance of\r\nbetween 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here almost\r\nevery product of the land and of the water bears the unmistakable stamp\r\nof the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds. Of these\r\ntwenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are ranked as distinct species,\r\nand would commonly be assumed to have been here created; yet the close\r\naffinity of most of these birds to American species is manifest in every\r\ncharacter in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with\r\nthe other animals, and with a large proportion of the plants, as\r\nshown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The\r\nnaturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the\r\nPacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, feels that\r\nhe is standing on American land. Why should this be so? Why should\r\nthe species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to\r\nthose created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in\r\nthe geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in\r\nthe proportions in which the several classes are associated together,\r\nwhich closely resembles the conditions of the South American coast. In\r\nfact, there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On\r\nthe other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the\r\nvolcanic nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the\r\nislands, between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but what an\r\nentire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of\r\nthe Galapagos to America. Facts, such as these, admit of no sort of\r\nexplanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on\r\nthe view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would\r\nbe likely to receive colonists from America, whether by occasional means\r\nof transport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly\r\ncontinuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists\r\nwould be liable to modification--the principle of inheritance still\r\nbetraying their original birthplace.\r\n\r\nMany analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal\r\nrule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the\r\nnearest continent, or of the nearest large island. The exceptions are\r\nfew, and most of them can be explained. Thus, although Kerguelen Land\r\nstands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are related, and\r\nthat very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of\r\nAmerica: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked\r\nby seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the\r\nprevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic\r\nplants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland,\r\nthan to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but\r\nit is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next\r\nnearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an\r\nanomaly. But this difficulty partially disappears on the view that New\r\nZealand, South America, and the other southern lands, have been stocked\r\nin part from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely, from\r\nthe antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, during\r\na warmer tertiary period, before the commencement of the last Glacial\r\nperiod. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker\r\nis real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia\r\nand of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this\r\naffinity is confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe same law which has determined the relationship between the\r\ninhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes displayed\r\non a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within the limits\r\nof the same archipelago. Thus each separate island of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one, by many\r\ndistinct species; but these species are related to each other in a very\r\nmuch closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American continent,\r\nor of any other quarter of the world. This is what might have been\r\nexpected, for islands situated so near to each other would almost\r\nnecessarily receive immigrants from the same original source, and\r\nfrom each other. But how is it that many of the immigrants have been\r\ndifferently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands situated\r\nwithin sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same\r\nheight, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but\r\nit arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering\r\nthe physical conditions of a country as the most important; whereas it\r\ncannot be disputed that the nature of the other species with which\r\neach has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far\r\nmore important element of success. Now if we look to the species which\r\ninhabit the Galapagos Archipelago, and are likewise found in other\r\nparts of the world, we find that they differ considerably in the several\r\nislands. This difference might indeed have been expected if the\r\nislands have been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for\r\ninstance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of\r\nanother plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same\r\ngeneral source. Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled\r\non one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to\r\nanother, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the\r\ndifferent islands, for it would have to compete with a different set of\r\norganisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best-fitted for\r\nit occupied by somewhat different species in the different islands, and\r\nwould be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If, then,\r\nit varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties\r\nin the different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet\r\nretain the same character throughout the group, just as we see some\r\nspecies spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the same.\r\n\r\nThe really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,\r\nand in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that each new species\r\nafter being formed in any one island, did not spread quickly to the\r\nother islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are\r\nseparated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British\r\nChannel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former\r\nperiod been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and\r\ndeep between the islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so\r\nthat the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than\r\nthey appear on a map. Nevertheless, some of the species, both of\r\nthose found in other parts of the world and of those confined to the\r\narchipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer from\r\nthe present manner of distribution that they have spread from one island\r\nto the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the\r\nprobability of closely allied species invading each other's territory,\r\nwhen put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly, if one species has\r\nany advantage over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in\r\npart supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own\r\nplaces, both will probably hold their separate places for almost\r\nany length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species,\r\nnaturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity\r\nover wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species would thus\r\nspread; but we should remember that the species which become naturalised\r\nin new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants, but are very distinct forms, belonging in a large\r\nproportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera.\r\nIn the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well\r\nadapted for flying from island to island, differ on the different\r\nislands; thus there are three closely allied species of mocking-thrush,\r\neach confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush\r\nof Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own\r\nmocking-thrush; why should it succeed in establishing itself there?\r\nWe may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own\r\nspecies, for annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched\r\nthan can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush\r\npeculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is\r\nthe species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston\r\nhave communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject;\r\nnamely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many\r\ndistinct but representative species of land-shells, some of which\r\nlive in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are\r\nannually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island\r\nhas not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless, both\r\nislands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no\r\ndoubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From these\r\nconsiderations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic species\r\nwhich inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not\r\nhaving all spread from island to island. On the same continent, also,\r\npre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the\r\ncommingling of the species which inhabit different districts with\r\nnearly the same physical conditions. Thus, the south-east and south-west\r\ncorners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are\r\nunited by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of\r\ndistinct mammals, birds, and plants; so it is, according to Mr. Bates,\r\nwith the butterflies and other animals inhabiting the great, open, and\r\ncontinuous valley of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe same principle which governs the general character of the\r\ninhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source\r\nwhence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with\r\ntheir subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout\r\nnature. We see this on every mountain-summit, in every lake and marsh.\r\nFor Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have become\r\nwidely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of\r\nthe surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine\r\nhumming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc., all strictly\r\nbelonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as\r\nit became slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding\r\nlowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting\r\nin so far as great facility of transport has allowed the same forms\r\nto prevail throughout large portions of the world. We see the same\r\nprinciple in the character of most of the blind animals inhabiting the\r\ncaves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts could be given.\r\nIt will, I believe, be found universally true, that wherever in\r\ntwo regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or\r\nrepresentative species occur, there will likewise be found some\r\nidentical species; and wherever many closely-allied species occur,\r\nthere will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct\r\nspecies, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms showing us\r\nthe steps in the process of modification.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the power and extent of migration in certain\r\nspecies, either at the present or at some former period, and the\r\nexistence at remote points of the world of closely allied species, is\r\nshown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long\r\nago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of\r\nthe species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule\r\nis generally true, though difficult of proof. Among mammals, we see it\r\nstrikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and\r\nCanidae. We see the same rule in the distribution of butterflies and\r\nbeetles. So it is with most of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many\r\nof the genera in the most distinct classes range over the world, and\r\nmany of the species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but\r\nthat some of the species have very wide ranges in the genera which range\r\nvery widely. Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have, on an\r\naverage, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far the\r\nprocess of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties of the\r\nsame species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the species has an\r\nimmense range; but, if variation were to be carried a little further,\r\nthe two varieties would be ranked as distinct species, and their range\r\nwould be greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that species which\r\nhave the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the\r\ncase of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely;\r\nfor we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the\r\npower of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being\r\nvictorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign\r\nassociates. But according to the view that all the species of a genus,\r\nthough distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descended\r\nfrom a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a general\r\nrule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely.\r\n\r\nWe should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of ancient\r\norigin, and the species in this case will have had ample time for\r\ndispersal and subsequent modification. There is also reason to believe,\r\nfrom geological evidence, that within each great class the lower\r\norganisms change at a slower rate than the higher; consequently they\r\nwill have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining\r\nthe same specific character. This fact, together with that of the seeds\r\nand eggs of most lowly organised forms being very minute and better\r\nfitted for distant transportal, probably accounts for a law which has\r\nlong been observed, and which has lately been discussed by Alph. de\r\nCandolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of\r\norganisms stands the more widely it ranges.\r\n\r\nThe relations just discussed--namely, lower organisms ranging more\r\nwidely than the higher--some of the species of widely-ranging genera\r\nthemselves ranging widely--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and\r\nmarsh productions being generally related to those which live on the\r\nsurrounding low lands and dry lands--the striking relationship between\r\nthe inhabitants of islands and those of the nearest mainland--the still\r\ncloser relationship of the distinct inhabitants of the islands of\r\nthe same archipelago--are inexplicable on the ordinary view of the\r\nindependent creation of each species, but are explicable if we admit\r\ncolonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the\r\nsubsequent adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE LAST AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\nIn these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due\r\nallowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate\r\nand of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the\r\nrecent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred--if we\r\nremember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of\r\noccasional transport--if we bear in mind, and this is a very important\r\nconsideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a\r\nwide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts--the\r\ndifficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of\r\nthe same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents.\r\nAnd we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many\r\nnaturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by\r\nvarious general considerations, more especially from the importance\r\nof barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of\r\nsubgenera, genera, and families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus, which\r\non our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same\r\nallowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of\r\nlife have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time having been thus\r\ngranted for their migration, the difficulties are far from insuperable;\r\nthough in this case, as in that of the individuals of the same species,\r\nthey are often great.\r\n\r\nAs exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I\r\nhave attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has\r\nplayed, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during\r\nthe alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed the\r\nproductions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them\r\nstranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As showing\r\nhow diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed\r\nat some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long\r\ncourse of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise\r\nof the several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded\r\nfrom some one source; then all the grand leading facts of geographical\r\ndistribution are explicable on the theory of migration, together with\r\nsubsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus\r\nunderstand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, in\r\nnot only separating but in apparently forming the several zoological and\r\nbotanical provinces. We can thus understand the concentration of related\r\nspecies within the same areas; and how it is that under different\r\nlatitudes, for instance, in South America, the inhabitants of the plains\r\nand mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are linked together\r\nin so mysterious a manner, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings\r\nwhich formerly inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the\r\nmutual relation of organism to organism is of the highest importance,\r\nwe can see why two areas, having nearly the same physical conditions,\r\nshould often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according\r\nto the length of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one\r\nof the regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication\r\nwhich allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater\r\nor lesser numbers; according or not as those which entered happened to\r\ncome into more or less direct competition with each other and with the\r\naborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying\r\nmore or less rapidly, there would ensue in the to or more regions,\r\nindependently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified\r\nconditions of life; there would be an almost endless amount of organic\r\naction and reaction, and we should find some groups of beings greatly,\r\nand some only slightly modified; some developed in great force, some\r\nexisting in scanty numbers--and this we do find in the several great\r\ngeographical provinces of the world.\r\n\r\nOn these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to\r\nshow, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of\r\nthese, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in\r\nrelation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have all\r\nits species peculiar, and another group, even within the same class,\r\nshould have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter\r\nof the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians\r\nand terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst\r\nthe most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar species of\r\naerial mammals or bats. We can see why, in islands, there should be some\r\nrelation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified\r\ncondition, and the depth of the sea between such islands and the\r\nmainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago,\r\nthough specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely\r\nrelated to each other, and should likewise be related, but less closely,\r\nto those of the nearest continent, or other source whence immigrants\r\nmight have been derived. We can see why, if there exist very closely\r\nallied or representative species in two areas, however distant from each\r\nother, some identical species will almost always there be found.\r\n\r\nAs the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking\r\nparallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws\r\ngoverning the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same\r\nwith those governing at the present time the differences in different\r\nareas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and\r\ngroup of species is continuous in time; for the apparent exceptions to\r\nthe rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having\r\nas yet discovered in an intermediate deposit certain forms which are\r\nabsent in it, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly\r\nis the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a\r\ngroup of species, is continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare,\r\nmay, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations\r\nunder different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport,\r\nor by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. Both\r\nin time and space species and groups of species have their points of\r\nmaximum development. Groups of species, living during the same period\r\nof time, or living within the same area, are often characterised by\r\ntrifling features in common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking to\r\nthe long succession of past ages, as in looking to distant provinces\r\nthroughout the world, we find that species in certain classes differ\r\nlittle from each other, whilst those in another class, or only in a\r\ndifferent section of the same order, differ greatly from each other. In\r\nboth time and space the lowly organised members of each class generally\r\nchange less than the highly organised; but there are in both cases\r\nmarked exceptions to the rule. According to our theory, these several\r\nrelations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we\r\nlook to the allied forms of life which have changed during successive\r\nages, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant\r\nquarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond of ordinary\r\ngeneration; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same,\r\nand modifications have been accumulated by the same means of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

MUTUAL AFFINITIES OF ORGANIC BEINGS:\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY--EMBRYOLOGY--RUDIMENTARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n Classification, groups subordinate to groups--Natural system--Rules and\r\n difficulties in classification, explained on the theory of descent\r\n with modification--Classification of varieties--Descent always used in\r\n classification--Analogical or adaptive characters--Affinities,\r\n general, complex and radiating--Extinction separates and defines\r\n groups--Morphology, between members of the same class, between parts of\r\n the same individual--Embryology, laws of, explained by variations not\r\n supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding\r\n age--Rudimentary organs; their origin explained--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nFrom the most remote period in the history of the world organic beings\r\nhave been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that\r\nthey can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is\r\nnot arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. The\r\nexistence of groups would have been of simple significance, if one group\r\nhad been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water;\r\none to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the\r\ncase is widely different, for it is notorious how commonly members of\r\neven the same subgroup have different habits. In the second and fourth\r\nchapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted\r\nto show that within each country it is the widely ranging, the much\r\ndiffused and common, that is the dominant species, belonging to\r\nthe larger genera in each class, which vary most. The varieties, or\r\nincipient species, thus produced, ultimately become converted into new\r\nand distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend\r\nto produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups which\r\nare now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend\r\nto go on increasing in size. I further attempted to show that from the\r\nvarying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as\r\ndifferent places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly\r\ntend to diverge in character. This latter conclusion is supported by\r\nobserving the great diversity of forms, which, in any small area, come\r\ninto the closest competition, and by certain facts in naturalisation.\r\n\r\nI attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the forms\r\nwhich are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant\r\nand exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms.\r\nI request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as\r\nformerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that\r\nthe inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from\r\none progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In\r\nthe diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus\r\nincluding several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper\r\nline form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient\r\nparent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the\r\nthree genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in\r\ncommon, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next\r\ntwo genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at\r\nthe fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much in common,\r\nthough less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family\r\ndistinct from that containing the three genera still further to the\r\nright hand, which diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera,\r\ndescended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended\r\nfrom (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single\r\nprogenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies,\r\nfamilies and orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the\r\nnatural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which,\r\nfrom its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in\r\nmy judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other\r\nobjects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single\r\ncharacters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know,\r\nfor instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus\r\narranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical\r\nsuccession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling\r\ninto groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the view\r\nabove given accords with their natural arrangement in group under group;\r\nand no other explanation has ever been attempted.\r\n\r\nNaturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera and\r\nfamilies in each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what\r\nis meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for\r\narranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for\r\nseparating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method of\r\nenunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions--that is,\r\nby one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all\r\nmammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those\r\ncommon to the dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full\r\ndescription is given of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of\r\nthis system are indisputable. But many naturalists think that something\r\nmore is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the\r\nplan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time\r\nor space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator,\r\nit seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Expressions\r\nsuch as that famous one by Linnaeus, which we often meet with in a more\r\nor less concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the\r\ngenus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some\r\ndeeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance.\r\nI believe that this is the case, and that community of descent--the one\r\nknown cause of close similarity in organic beings--is the bond, which,\r\nthough observed by various degrees of modification, is partially\r\nrevealed to us by our classifications.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the\r\ndifficulties which are encountered on the view that classification\r\neither gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for\r\nenunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most\r\nlike each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times\r\nthought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits\r\nof life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature,\r\nwould be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more\r\nfalse. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of\r\na dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These\r\nresemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the\r\nbeing, are ranked as merely \"adaptive or analogical characters;\" but to\r\nthe consideration of these resemblances we shall recur. It may even be\r\ngiven as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation\r\nis concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for\r\nclassification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says,\r\n\"The generative organs, being those which are most remotely related to\r\nthe habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording\r\nvery clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in\r\nthe modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an\r\nessential character.\" With plants how remarkable it is that the organs\r\nof vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little\r\nsignification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product\r\nthe seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again, in formerly\r\ndiscussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally\r\nimportant, we have seen that they are often of the highest service in\r\nclassification. This depends on their constancy throughout many allied\r\ngroups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight deviations not\r\nhaving been preserved and accumulated by natural selection, which acts\r\nonly on serviceable characters.\r\n\r\nThat the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine\r\nits classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact, that in allied\r\ngroups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has\r\nnearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely\r\ndifferent. No naturalist can have worked at any group without being\r\nstruck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the\r\nwritings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest\r\nauthority, Robert Brown, who, in speaking of certain organs in the\r\nProteaceae, says their generic importance, \"like that of all their\r\nparts, not only in this, but, as I apprehend in every natural family,\r\nis very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.\" Again,\r\nin another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceae \"differ in having\r\none or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the\r\nimbricate or valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is\r\nfrequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when\r\nall taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from\r\nConnarus.\" To give an example among insects: in one great division\r\nof the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most\r\nconstant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the\r\ndifferences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one\r\nwill say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are\r\nof unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could be\r\ngiven of the varying importance for classification of the same important\r\norgan within the same group of beings.\r\n\r\nAgain, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high\r\nphysiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this\r\ncondition are often of much value in classification. No one will dispute\r\nthat the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants,\r\nand certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in\r\nexhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert\r\nBrown has strongly insisted on the fact that the position of the\r\nrudimentary florets is of the highest importance in the classification\r\nof the Grasses.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which\r\nmust be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which\r\nare universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of\r\nwhole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from\r\nthe nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which\r\nabsolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the\r\nangle of the lower jaw in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of\r\ninsects are folded--mere colour in certain Algae--mere pubescence on\r\nparts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as\r\nhair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been\r\ncovered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling\r\ncharacter would have been considered by naturalists as an important aid\r\nin determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds.\r\n\r\nThe importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly\r\ndepends on their being correlated with many other characters of more or\r\nless importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very\r\nevident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a\r\nspecies may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high\r\nphysiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and yet\r\nleave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been\r\nfound that a classification founded on any single character,\r\nhowever important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the\r\norganisation is invariably constant. The importance of an aggregate of\r\ncharacters, even when none are important, alone explains the aphorism\r\nenunciated by Linnaeus, namely, that the characters do not give the\r\ngenus, but the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the\r\nappreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be\r\ndefined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect\r\nand degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, \"The\r\ngreater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus,\r\nto the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our\r\nclassification.\" When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several\r\nyears, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number\r\nof the most important points of structure from the proper type of the\r\norder, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this\r\ngenus should still be retained among the Malpighiaceae. This case well\r\nillustrates the spirit of our classifications.\r\n\r\nPractically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble\r\nthemselves about the physiological value of the characters which they\r\nuse in defining a group or in allocating any particular species. If they\r\nfind a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms,\r\nand not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to\r\nsome lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle\r\nhas been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and\r\nby none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire.\r\nIf several trifling characters are always found in combination, though\r\nno apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial\r\nvalue is set on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs,\r\nsuch as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for\r\npropagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as\r\nhighly serviceable in classification; but in some groups all these,\r\nthe most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite\r\nsubordinate value. Thus, as Fritz Muller has lately remarked, in the\r\nsame group of crustaceans, Cypridina is furnished with a heart, while in\r\ntwo closely allied genera, namely Cypris and Cytherea, there is no such\r\norgan; one species of Cypridina has well-developed branchiae, while\r\nanother species is destitute of them.\r\n\r\nWe can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of\r\nequal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural\r\nclassification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means\r\nobvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should\r\nbe more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone\r\nplays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly\r\nurged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that\r\nembryological characters are the most important of all; and this\r\ndoctrine has very generally been admitted as true. Nevertheless,\r\ntheir importance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing to the adaptive\r\ncharacters of larvae not having been excluded; in order to show this,\r\nFritz Muller arranged, by the aid of such characters alone, the great\r\nclass of crustaceans, and the arrangement did not prove a natural one.\r\nBut there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters,\r\nare of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but\r\nwith plants. Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on\r\ndifferences in the embryo--on the number and position of the cotyledons,\r\nand on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. We shall\r\nimmediately see why these characters possess so high a value in\r\nclassification, namely, from the natural system being genealogical in\r\nits arrangement.\r\n\r\nOur classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of\r\naffinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters\r\ncommon to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such definition has\r\nhitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite\r\nends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the\r\nspecies at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to\r\nothers, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to\r\nthis, and to no other class of the Articulata.\r\n\r\nGeographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite\r\nlogically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of\r\nclosely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity\r\nof this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by\r\nseveral entomologists and botanists.\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\r\nspecies, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera,\r\nthey seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the\r\nbest botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted\r\non their arbitrary value. Instances could be given among plants and\r\ninsects, of a group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a\r\ngenus, and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this\r\nhas been done, not because further research has detected important\r\nstructural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous\r\nallied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been\r\nsubsequently discovered.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may\r\nbe explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that\r\nthe natural system is founded on descent with modification--that the\r\ncharacters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between\r\nany two or more species, are those which have been inherited from\r\na common parent, all true classification being genealogical--that\r\ncommunity of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been\r\nunconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the\r\nenunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and\r\nseparating objects more or less alike.\r\n\r\nBut I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the ARRANGEMENT\r\nof the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to\r\neach other, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but\r\nthat the AMOUNT of difference in the several branches or groups, though\r\nallied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may\r\ndiffer greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which\r\nthey have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked\r\nunder different genera, families, sections or orders. The reader will\r\nbest understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to\r\nthe diagram in the fourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L\r\nto represent allied genera existing during the Silurian epoch, and\r\ndescended from some still earlier form. In three of these genera (A,\r\nF, and I) a species has transmitted modified descendants to the present\r\nday, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost\r\nhorizontal line. Now, all these modified descendants from a single\r\nspecies are related in blood or descent in the same degree. They may\r\nmetaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree, yet\r\nthey differ widely and in different degrees from each other. The forms\r\ndescended from A, now broken up into two or three families, constitute\r\na distinct order from those descended from I, also broken up into two\r\nfamilies. Nor can the existing species descended from A be ranked in\r\nthe same genus with the parent A, or those from I with parent I. But the\r\nexisting genus F14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified,\r\nand it will then rank with the parent genus F; just as some few still\r\nliving organisms belong to Silurian genera. So that the comparative\r\nvalue of the differences between these organic beings, which are all\r\nrelated to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely\r\ndifferent. Nevertheless, their genealogical ARRANGEMENT remains strictly\r\ntrue, not only at the present time, but at each successive period\r\nof descent. All the modified descendants from A will have inherited\r\nsomething in common from their common parent, as will all the\r\ndescendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate branch of\r\ndescendants at each successive stage. If, however, we suppose any\r\ndescendant of A or of I to have become so much modified as to have\r\nlost all traces of its parentage in this case, its place in the natural\r\nsystem will be lost, as seems to have occurred with some few existing\r\norganisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of\r\ndescent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they form\r\na single genus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy\r\nits proper intermediate position. The representation of the groups as\r\nhere given in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The\r\nbranches ought to have diverged in all directions. If the names of\r\nthe groups had been simply written down in a linear series the\r\nrepresentation would have been still less natural; and it is notoriously\r\nnot possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities\r\nwhich we discover in nature among the beings of the same group. Thus,\r\nthe natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree.\r\nBut the amount of modification which the different groups have undergone\r\nhas to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera,\r\nsubfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by\r\ntaking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of\r\nmankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the\r\nbest classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the\r\nworld; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly\r\nchanging dialects, were to be included, such an arrangement would be\r\nthe only possible one. Yet it might be that some ancient languages had\r\naltered very little and had given rise to few new languages, whilst\r\nothers had altered much owing to the spreading, isolation and state of\r\ncivilisation of the several co-descended races, and had thus given rise\r\nto many new dialects and languages. The various degrees of difference\r\nbetween the languages of the same stock would have to be expressed by\r\ngroups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even the only possible\r\narrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly\r\nnatural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and recent,\r\nby the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of\r\neach tongue.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of\r\nvarieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single\r\nspecies. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties\r\nunder the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon,\r\nwith several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are\r\nfollowed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the\r\nnecessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial\r\nsystem; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of\r\nthe pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most\r\nimportant part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish\r\nand common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems\r\nare so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in\r\nclassing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns\r\nare very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less\r\nvariable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep\r\nthe horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing\r\nvarieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical\r\nclassification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted\r\nin some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or\r\nless modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the\r\nforms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In\r\ntumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important\r\ncharacter of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from\r\nhaving the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has\r\nnearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on\r\nthe subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied\r\nin blood and alike in some other respects.\r\n\r\nWith species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought\r\ndescent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,\r\nthat of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes\r\ndiffer in the most important characters is known to every naturalist:\r\nscarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the adult males\r\nand hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no one dreams of\r\nseparating them. As soon as the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus,\r\nMyanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been ranked as three\r\ndistinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same plant,\r\nthey were immediately considered as varieties; and now I have been able\r\nto show that they are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the\r\nsame species. The naturalist includes as one species the various larval\r\nstages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each\r\nother and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate generations\r\nof Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as\r\nthe same individual. He includes monsters and varieties, not from their\r\npartial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they are descended\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAs descent has universally been used in classing together the\r\nindividuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae\r\nare sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing\r\nvarieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable\r\namount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been\r\nunconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under\r\nhigher groups, all under the so-called natural system? I believe it\r\nhas been unconsciously used; and thus only can I understand the several\r\nrules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists.\r\nAs we have no written pedigrees, we are forced to trace community\r\nof descent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore, we choose those\r\ncharacters which are the least likely to have been modified, in relation\r\nto the conditions of life to which each species has been recently\r\nexposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even\r\nsometimes better than other parts of the organisation. We care not how\r\ntrifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle\r\nof the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the\r\nskin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and\r\ndifferent species, especially those having very different habits of\r\nlife, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so\r\nmany forms with such different habits, only by inheritance from a\r\ncommon parent. We may err in this respect in regard to single points of\r\nstructure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling,\r\nconcur throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we\r\nmay feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters\r\nhave been inherited from a common ancestor; and we know that such\r\naggregated characters have especial value in classification.\r\n\r\nWe can understand why a species or a group of species may depart from\r\nits allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and yet be\r\nsafely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often done,\r\nas long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so\r\nunimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two\r\nforms have not a single character in common, yet, if these extreme forms\r\nare connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at\r\nonce infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same\r\nclass. As we find organs of high physiological importance--those\r\nwhich serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of\r\nexistence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to\r\nthem; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a\r\ngroup, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our\r\nclassification. We shall presently see why embryological characters are\r\nof such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution\r\nmay sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large genera,\r\nbecause all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and\r\nisolated region, are in all probability descended from the same parents.\r\n\r\nANALOGICAL RESEMBLANCES.\r\n\r\nWe can understand, on the above views, the very important distinction\r\nbetween real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck\r\nfirst called attention to this subject, and he has been ably followed by\r\nMacleay and others. The resemblance in the shape of the body and in the\r\nfin-like anterior limbs between dugongs and whales, and between these\r\ntwo orders of mammals and fishes, are analogical. So is the resemblance\r\nbetween a mouse and a shrew-mouse (Sorex), which belong to different\r\norders; and the still closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart,\r\nbetween the mouse and a small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of\r\nAustralia. These latter resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems\r\nto me, by adaptation for similarly active movements through thickets and\r\nherbage, together with concealment from enemies.\r\n\r\nAmong insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus, misled by\r\nexternal appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth.\r\nWe see something of the same kind even with our domestic varieties, as\r\nin the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of\r\nthe Chinese and common pig, which are descended from distinct species;\r\nand in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically\r\ndistinct Swedish turnip. The resemblance between the greyhound and\r\nrace-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been\r\ndrawn by some authors between widely different animals.\r\n\r\nOn the view of characters being of real importance for classification,\r\nonly in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why\r\nanalogical or adaptive characters, although of the utmost importance to\r\nthe welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist.\r\nFor animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may have\r\nbecome adapted to similar conditions, and thus have assumed a close\r\nexternal resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather\r\ntend to conceal their blood-relationship. We can thus also understand\r\nthe apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when\r\none group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the\r\nmembers of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of the\r\nbody and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared\r\nwith fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through\r\nthe water; but between the the several members of the whale family, the\r\nshape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting\r\ntrue affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout\r\nthe whole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a\r\ncommon ancestor. So it is with fishes.\r\n\r\nNumerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite distinct\r\nbeings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted for the\r\nsame functions. A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of\r\nthe jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or Thylacinus--animals which are\r\nwidely sundered in the natural system. But this resemblance is confined\r\nto general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the\r\ncutting shape of the molar teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus\r\nthe dog has on each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two\r\nmolars; while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars.\r\nThe molars also differ much in the two animals in relative size and\r\nstructure. The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk\r\ndentition. Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either case\r\nhave been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of\r\nsuccessive variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is\r\nunintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other. I am glad to\r\nfind that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to this same\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely different\r\nfishes possessing electric organs--of widely different insects\r\npossessing luminous organs--and of orchids and asclepiads having\r\npollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of analogical\r\nresemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that they were introduced\r\nas difficulties or objections to our theory. In all such cases some\r\nfundamental difference in the growth or development of the parts, and\r\ngenerally in their matured structure, can be detected. The end gained is\r\nthe same, but the means, though appearing superficially to be the same,\r\nare essentially different. The principle formerly alluded to under the\r\nterm of ANALOGICAL VARIATION has probably in these cases often come into\r\nplay; that is, the members of the same class, although only distantly\r\nallied, have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that\r\nthey are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar\r\nmanner; and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural\r\nselection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other, independently\r\nof their direct inheritance from a common progenitor.\r\n\r\nAs species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted\r\nby successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar\r\ncircumstances--to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land,\r\nair and water--we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical\r\nparallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups of\r\ndistinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a parallelism of this\r\nnature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in\r\nseveral classes (and all our experience shows that their valuation is as\r\nyet arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range;\r\nand thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary and ternary classifications\r\nhave probably arisen.\r\n\r\nThere is another and curious class of cases in which close external\r\nresemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits of life, but\r\nhas been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to the wonderful\r\nmanner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first described by Mr.\r\nBates, other and quite distinct species. This excellent observer has\r\nshown that in some districts of South America, where, for instance, an\r\nIthomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another butterfly, namely, a Leptalis,\r\nis often found mingled in the same flock; and the latter so closely\r\nresembles the Ithomia in every shade and stripe of colour, and even\r\nin the shape of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened\r\nby collecting during eleven years, was, though always on his guard,\r\ncontinually deceived. When the mockers and the mocked are caught and\r\ncompared, they are found to be very different in essential structure,\r\nand to belong not only to distinct genera, but often to distinct\r\nfamilies. Had this mimicry occurred in only one or two instances, it\r\nmight have been passed over as a strange coincidence. But, if we proceed\r\nfrom a district where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another mocking\r\nand mocked species, belonging to the same two genera, equally close in\r\ntheir resemblance, may be found. Altogether no less than ten genera are\r\nenumerated, which include species that imitate other butterflies. The\r\nmockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find an\r\nimitator living remote from the form which it imitates. The mockers are\r\nalmost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case abounds\r\nin swarms. In the same district in which a species of Leptalis closely\r\nimitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes other Lepidoptera mimicking\r\nthe same Ithomia: so that in the same place, species of three genera of\r\nbutterflies and even a moth are found all closely resembling a butterfly\r\nbelonging to a fourth genus. It deserves especial notice that many of\r\nthe mimicking forms of the Leptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms,\r\ncan be shown by a graduated series to be merely varieties of the same\r\nspecies; while others are undoubtedly distinct species. But why, it may\r\nbe asked, are certain forms treated as the mimicked and others as the\r\nmimickers? Mr. Bates satisfactorily answers this question by showing\r\nthat the form which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to\r\nwhich it belongs, while the counterfeiters have changed their dress and\r\ndo not resemble their nearest allies.\r\n\r\nWe are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for certain\r\nbutterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and\r\nquite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature\r\ncondescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit on\r\nthe true explanation. The mocked forms, which always abound in numbers,\r\nmust habitually escape destruction to a large extent, otherwise they\r\ncould not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of evidence has now\r\nbeen collected, showing that they are distasteful to birds and other\r\ninsect-devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the other hand, that\r\ninhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and belong to\r\nrare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some danger, for\r\notherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies, they would\r\nin three or four generations swarm over the whole country. Now if a\r\nmember of one of these persecuted and rare groups were to assume a dress\r\nso like that of a well-protected species that it continually deceived\r\nthe practised eyes of an entomologist, it would often deceive predaceous\r\nbirds and insects, and thus often escape destruction. Mr. Bates may\r\nalmost be said to have actually witnessed the process by which the\r\nmimickers have come so closely to resemble the mimicked; for he\r\nfound that some of the forms of Leptalis which mimic so many other\r\nbutterflies, varied in an extreme degree. In one district several\r\nvarieties occurred, and of these one alone resembled, to a certain\r\nextent, the common Ithomia of the same district. In another district\r\nthere were two or three varieties, one of which was much commoner than\r\nthe others, and this closely mocked another form of Ithomia. From facts\r\nof this nature, Mr. Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies; and\r\nwhen a variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly\r\ninhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to a\r\nflourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping\r\ndestruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently\r\noftener preserved; \"the less perfect degrees of resemblance being\r\ngeneration after generation eliminated, and only the others left to\r\npropagate their kind.\" So that here we have an excellent illustration of\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several equally\r\nstriking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay Archipelago\r\nand Africa, and with some other insects. Mr. Wallace has also detected\r\none such case with birds, but we have none with the larger quadrupeds.\r\nThe much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other\r\nanimals, is probably the consequence of their small size; insects cannot\r\ndefend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a sting,\r\nand I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking other\r\ninsects, though they are mocked; insects cannot easily escape by\r\nflight from the larger animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking\r\nmetaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery\r\nand dissimulation.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the process of imitation probably never\r\ncommenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But, starting with\r\nspecies already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance,\r\nif beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if\r\nthe imitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through any\r\nagency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus\r\nbe altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an\r\nappearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the\r\nfamily to which it belonged. There is, however, some difficulty on this\r\nhead, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members\r\nbelonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their\r\npresent extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and protected\r\ngroup in a sufficient degree to afford some slight protection, this\r\nhaving given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most\r\nperfect resemblance.\r\n\r\nON THE NATURE OF THE AFFINITIES CONNECTING ORGANIC BEINGS.\r\n\r\nAs the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger\r\ngenera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which\r\nthey belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to\r\nspread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of\r\nnature. The larger and more dominant groups within each class thus tend\r\nto go on increasing in size, and they consequently supplant many\r\nsmaller and feebler groups. Thus, we can account for the fact that all\r\norganisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders and\r\nunder still fewer classes. As showing how few the higher groups are in\r\nnumber, and how widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact\r\nis striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an insect\r\nbelonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn\r\nfrom Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three families of small size.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the\r\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character\r\nduring the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the\r\nmore ancient forms of life often present characters in some degree\r\nintermediate between existing groups. As some few of the old and\r\nintermediate forms having transmitted to the present day descendants\r\nbut little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or aberrant\r\ngroups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of\r\nconnecting forms which have been exterminated and utterly lost. And\r\nwe have evidence of aberrant groups having suffered severely from\r\nextinction, for they are almost always represented by extremely few\r\nspecies; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from\r\neach other, which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus\r\nand Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had\r\neach been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at present by a\r\nsingle one, or by two or three. We can, I think, account for this fact\r\nonly by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have been conquered\r\nby more successful competitors, with a few members still preserved under\r\nunusually favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of\r\nanimals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity\r\nin most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr.\r\nWaterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to\r\nMarsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its\r\nrelations are general, that is, not to any one Marsupial species more\r\nthan to another. As these points of affinity are believed to be real\r\nand not merely adaptive, they must be due in accordance with our view to\r\ninheritance from a common progenitor. Therefore, we must suppose either\r\nthat all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient\r\nMarsupial, which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in\r\ncharacter with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents\r\nand Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both\r\ngroups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions.\r\nOn either view we must suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by\r\ninheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have\r\nother Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one\r\nexisting Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from\r\nhaving partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or\r\nof some early member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials,\r\nas Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the Phascolomys resembles most nearly,\r\nnot any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case,\r\nhowever, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only\r\nanalogical, owing to the Phascolomys having become adapted to habits\r\nlike those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar\r\nobservations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct\r\nfamilies of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in\r\ncharacter of the species descended from a common progenitor, together\r\nwith their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can\r\nunderstand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all\r\nthe members of the same family or higher group are connected together.\r\nFor the common progenitor of a whole family, now broken up by extinction\r\ninto distinct groups and subgroups, will have transmitted some of its\r\ncharacters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all the species;\r\nand they will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines\r\nof affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often\r\nreferred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult\r\nto show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any\r\nancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and\r\nalmost impossible to do so without this aid, we can understand\r\nthe extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in\r\ndescribing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which\r\nthey perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same\r\ngreat natural class.\r\n\r\nExtinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an\r\nimportant part in defining and widening the intervals between the\r\nseveral groups in each class. We may thus account for the distinctness\r\nof whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds from all other\r\nvertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have\r\nbeen utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were\r\nformerly connected with the early progenitors of the other and at that\r\ntime less differentiated vertebrate classes. There has been much\r\nless extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with\r\nBatrachians. There has been still less within some whole classes, for\r\ninstance the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms\r\nare still linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of\r\naffinities. Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no means\r\nmade them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were\r\nsuddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give\r\ndefinitions by which each group could be distinguished, still a natural\r\nclassification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible.\r\nWe shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may\r\nrepresent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large\r\ngroups of modified descendants, with every link in each branch and\r\nsub-branch still alive; and the links not greater than those between\r\nexisting varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give\r\ndefinitions by which the several members of the several groups could be\r\ndistinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants. Yet the\r\narrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be natural;\r\nfor, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended, for\r\ninstance from A, would have something in common. In a tree we can\r\ndistinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite\r\nand blend together. We could not, as I have said, define the several\r\ngroups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of\r\nthe characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a\r\ngeneral idea of the value of the differences between them. This is what\r\nwe should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the\r\nforms in any one class which have lived throughout all time and space.\r\nAssuredly we shall never succeed in making so perfect a collection:\r\nnevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending toward this end;\r\nand Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high\r\nimportance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and\r\ndefine the groups to which such types belong.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from the\r\nstruggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to\r\nextinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any\r\none parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the\r\naffinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group\r\nunder group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals\r\nof both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may have\r\nbut few characters in common; we use descent in classing acknowledged\r\nvarieties, however different they may be from their parents; and I\r\nbelieve that this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion\r\nwhich naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System.\r\nOn this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been\r\nperfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of\r\ndifference expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, etc., we\r\ncan understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our\r\nclassification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far\r\nmore than others; why we use rudimentary and useless organs, or others\r\nof trifling physiological importance; why, in finding the relations\r\nbetween one group and another, we summarily reject analogical or\r\nadaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits\r\nof the same group. We can clearly see how it is that all living and\r\nextinct forms can be grouped together within a few great classes; and\r\nhow the several members of each class are connected together by the most\r\ncomplex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never, probably,\r\ndisentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between the members\r\nof any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not\r\nlook to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel in his \"Generelle Morphologie\" and in another works,\r\nhas recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what\r\nhe calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings.\r\nIn drawing up the several series he trusts chiefly to embryological\r\ncharacters, but receives aid from homologous and rudimentary organs, as\r\nwell as from the successive periods at which the various forms of life\r\nare believed to have first appeared in our geological formations. He has\r\nthus boldly made a great beginning, and shows us how classification will\r\nin the future be treated.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the members of the same class, independently of\r\ntheir habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their\r\norganisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term \"unity of\r\ntype;\" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different\r\nspecies of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under\r\nthe general term of Morphology. This is one of the most interesting\r\ndepartments of natural history, and may almost be said to be its very\r\nsoul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for\r\ngrasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle\r\nof the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on\r\nthe same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative\r\npositions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking\r\ninstance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted\r\nfor bounding over the open plains--those of the climbing, leaf-eating\r\nkoala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees--those\r\nof the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots--and those of\r\nsome other Australian marsupials--should all be constructed on the same\r\nextraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third digits\r\nextremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that they\r\nappear like a single toe furnished with two claws. Notwithstanding this\r\nsimilarity of pattern, it is obvious that the hind feet of these several\r\nanimals are used for as widely different purposes as it is possible to\r\nconceive. The case is rendered all the more striking by the American\r\nopossums, which follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their\r\nAustralian relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan.\r\nProfessor Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in\r\nconclusion: \"We may call this conformity to type, without getting much\r\nnearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;\" and he then adds \"but is\r\nit not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of inheritance from a\r\ncommon ancestor?\"\r\n\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high importance of\r\nrelative position or connexion in homologous parts; they may differ to\r\nalmost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected together in\r\nthe same invariable order. We never find, for instance, the bones of\r\nthe arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same\r\nnames can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals.\r\nWe see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects:\r\nwhat can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a\r\nsphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws\r\nof a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely different\r\npurposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper\r\nlip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The same law governs the\r\nconstruction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the\r\nflowers of plants.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity\r\nof pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine\r\nof final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly\r\nadmitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the \"Nature of Limbs.\"\r\nOn the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can\r\nonly say that so it is; that it has pleased the Creator to construct all\r\nthe animals and plants in each great class on a uniform plan; but this\r\nis not a scientific explanation.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of the\r\nselection of successive slight modifications, each being profitable in\r\nsome way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation other\r\nparts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be\r\nlittle or no tendency to alter the original pattern, or to transpose\r\nthe parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and flattened to any\r\nextent, becoming at the same time enveloped in thick membrane, so as to\r\nserve as a fin; or a webbed hand might have all its bones, or certain\r\nbones, lengthened to any extent, with the membrane connecting them\r\nincreased, so as to serve as a wing; yet all these modifications would\r\nnot tend to alter the framework of the bones or the relative connexion\r\nof the parts. If we suppose that an early progenitor--the archetype,\r\nas it may be called--of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs\r\nconstructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose\r\nthey served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the\r\nhomologous construction of the limbs throughout the class. So with the\r\nmouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor\r\nhad an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae, these parts\r\nbeing perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will\r\naccount for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the\r\nmouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general\r\npattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost,\r\nby the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of\r\ncertain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or\r\nmultiplication of others, variations which we know to be within\r\nthe limits of possibility. In the paddles of the gigantic extinct\r\nsea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the\r\ngeneral pattern seems thus to have become partially obscured.\r\n\r\nThere is another and equally curious branch of our subject; namely,\r\nserial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or organs\r\nin the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in different\r\nmembers of the same class. Most physiologists believe that the bones of\r\nthe skull are homologous--that is, correspond in number and in relative\r\nconnexion--with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae.\r\nThe anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes\r\nare plainly homologous. So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws\r\nand legs of crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in\r\na flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and\r\npistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the\r\nview that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In\r\nmonstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one\r\norgan being transformed into another; and we can actually see, during\r\nthe early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as\r\nin crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature\r\nbecome extremely different are at first exactly alike.\r\n\r\nHow inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the ordinary view\r\nof creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of\r\nsuch numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone apparently\r\nrepresenting vertebrae? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived\r\nfrom the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition by\r\nmammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of\r\nbirds and reptiles. Why should similar bones have been created to\r\nform the wing and the leg of a bat, used as they are for such\r\ntotally different purposes, namely flying and walking? Why should one\r\ncrustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts,\r\nconsequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many\r\nlegs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and\r\npistils, in each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be\r\nall constructed on the same pattern?\r\n\r\nOn the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent, answer\r\nthese questions. We need not here consider how the bodies of some\r\nanimals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they\r\nbecame divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs, for\r\nsuch questions are almost beyond investigation. It is, however, probable\r\nthat some serial structures are the result of cells multiplying by\r\ndivision, entailing the multiplication of the parts developed from\r\nsuch cells. It must suffice for our purpose to bear in mind that\r\nan indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common\r\ncharacteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little specialised\r\nforms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably\r\npossessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many\r\nsegments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves\r\narranged in one or more spires. We have also formerly seen that parts\r\nmany times repeated are eminently liable to vary, not only in number,\r\nbut in form. Consequently such parts, being already present in\r\nconsiderable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford\r\nthe materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they\r\nwould generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces\r\nof their original or fundamental resemblance. They would retain this\r\nresemblance all the more, as the variations, which afforded the basis\r\nfor their subsequent modification through natural selection, would\r\ntend from the first to be similar; the parts being at an early stage of\r\ngrowth alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions. Such\r\nparts, whether more or less modified, unless their common origin became\r\nwholly obscured, would be serially homologous.\r\n\r\nIn the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species\r\ncan be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies; such as the\r\nvalves of Chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom enabled\r\nto say that one part is homologous with another part in the same\r\nindividual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even\r\nin the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much\r\nindefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great\r\nclasses of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBut morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears,\r\nas has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E. Ray\r\nLankester, who has drawn an important distinction between certain\r\nclasses of cases which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as\r\nhomologous. He proposes to call the structures which resemble each other\r\nin distinct animals, owing to their descent from a common progenitor\r\nwith subsequent modification, \"homogenous\"; and the resemblances which\r\ncannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call \"homoplastic\". For\r\ninstance, he believes that the hearts of birds and mammals are as a\r\nwhole homogenous--that is, have been derived from a common progenitor;\r\nbut that the four cavities of the heart in the two classes are\r\nhomoplastic--that is, have been independently developed. Mr. Lankester\r\nalso adduces the close resemblance of the parts on the right and left\r\nsides of the body, and in the successive segments of the same individual\r\nanimal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous which bear no\r\nrelation to the descent of distinct species from a common progenitor.\r\nHomoplastic structures are the same with those which I have classed,\r\nthough in a very imperfect manner, as analogous modifications or\r\nresemblances. Their formation may be attributed in part to distinct\r\norganisms, or to distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in\r\nan analogous manner; and in part to similar modifications, having\r\nbeen preserved for the same general purpose or function, of which many\r\ninstances have been given.\r\n\r\nNaturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\r\nvertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and\r\npistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most cases\r\nbe more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both\r\nskull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, etc., as having been metamorphosed,\r\nnot one from the other, as they now exist, but from some common and\r\nsimpler element. Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a\r\nmetaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course\r\nof descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and\r\nlegs in the other--have actually been converted into skulls or jaws. Yet\r\nso strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists\r\ncan hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification.\r\nAccording to the views here maintained, such language may be used\r\nliterally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab\r\nretaining numerous characters, which they probably would have retained\r\nthrough inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true\r\nthough extremely simple legs, is in part explained.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT AND EMBRYOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural\r\nhistory. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is familiar,\r\nare generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the transformations\r\nare in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed. A certain\r\nephemerous insect (Chloeon) during its development, moults, as shown by\r\nSir J. Lubbock, above twenty times, and each time undergoes a certain\r\namount of change; and in this case we see the act of metamorphosis\r\nperformed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects, and especially\r\ncertain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be\r\neffected during development. Such changes, however, reach their acme in\r\nthe so-called alternate generations of some of the lower animals. It is,\r\nfor instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline,\r\nstudded with polypi, and attached to a submarine rock, should produce,\r\nfirst by budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge\r\nfloating jelly-fishes; and that these should produce eggs, from which\r\nare hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and\r\nbecome developed into branching corallines; and so on in an endless\r\ncycle. The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate\r\ngeneration and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly strengthened\r\nby Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, namely the\r\nCecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these others, which\r\nfinally are developed into mature males and females, propagating their\r\nkind in the ordinary manner by eggs.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth notice that when Wagner's remarkable discovery was first\r\nannounced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the larvae of\r\nthis fly having acquired the power of a sexual reproduction. As long as\r\nthe case remained unique no answer could be given. But already Grimm has\r\nshown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the\r\nsame manner, and he believes that this occurs frequently in the order.\r\nIt is the pupa, and not the larva, of the Chironomus which has this\r\npower; and Grimm further shows that this case, to a certain extent,\r\n\"unites that of the Cecidomyia with the parthenogenesis of the\r\nCoccidae;\" the term parthenogenesis implying that the mature females of\r\nthe Coccidae are capable of producing fertile eggs without the concourse\r\nof the male. Certain animals belonging to several classes are now known\r\nto have the power of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age;\r\nand we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic reproduction by gradual\r\nsteps to an earlier and earlier age--Chironomus showing us an almost\r\nexactly intermediate stage, viz., that of the pupa--and we can perhaps\r\naccount for the marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that various parts in the same individual,\r\nwhich are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become widely\r\ndifferent and serve for widely different purposes in the adult state. So\r\nagain it has been shown that generally the embryos of the most distinct\r\nspecies belonging to the same class are closely similar, but become,\r\nwhen fully developed, widely dissimilar. A better proof of this latter\r\nfact cannot be given than the statement by Von Baer that \"the embryos of\r\nmammalia, of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are\r\nin the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and\r\nin the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact, that we\r\ncan often distinguish the embryos only by their size. In my possession\r\nare two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have omitted to attach,\r\nand at present I am quite unable to say to what class they belong. They\r\nmay be lizards or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is\r\nthe similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these\r\nanimals. The extremities, however, are still absent in these embryos.\r\nBut even if they had existed in the earliest stage of their development\r\nwe should learn nothing, for the feet of lizards and mammals, the wings\r\nand feet of birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise\r\nfrom the same fundamental form.\" The larvae of most crustaceans, at\r\ncorresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other,\r\nhowever different the adults may become; and so it is with very many\r\nother animals. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance occasionally\r\nlasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of\r\nallied genera, often resemble each other in their immature plumage; as\r\nwe see in the spotted feathers in the young of the thrush group. In\r\nthe cat tribe, most of the species when adult are striped or spotted in\r\nlines; and stripes or spots can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of\r\nthe lion and the puma. We occasionally, though rarely, see something of\r\nthe same kind in plants; thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and\r\nthe first leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided\r\nlike the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.\r\n\r\nThe points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different\r\nanimals within the same class resemble each other, often have no direct\r\nrelation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance,\r\nsuppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like\r\ncourses of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar\r\nconditions--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its\r\nmother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the\r\nspawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such a\r\nrelation than we have to believe that the similar bones in the hand of\r\na man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar\r\nconditions of life. No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of\r\na lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is different when an animal, during any part of its\r\nembryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself. The period\r\nof activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes\r\non, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as\r\nperfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. In how important a\r\nmanner this has acted, has recently been well shown by Sir J. Lubbock\r\nin his remarks on the close similarity of the larvae of some insects\r\nbelonging to very different orders, and on the dissimilarity of the\r\nlarvae of other insects within the same order, according to their habits\r\nof life. Owing to such adaptations the similarity of the larvae of\r\nallied animals is sometimes greatly obscured; especially when there is\r\na division of labour during the different stages of development, as\r\nwhen the same larva has during one stage to search for food, and during\r\nanother stage has to search for a place of attachment. Cases can even be\r\ngiven of the larvae of allied species, or groups of species, differing\r\nmore from each other than do the adults. In most cases, however, the\r\nlarvae, though active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of\r\ncommon embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of\r\nthis: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was\r\na crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable\r\nmanner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated\r\nand sessile, though differing widely in external appearance, have larvae\r\nin all their stages barely distinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation.\r\nI use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to\r\ndefine clearly what is meant by organisation being higher or lower.\r\nBut no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than\r\nthe caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal must be\r\nconsidered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain\r\nparasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in\r\nthe first stage have three pairs of locomotive organs, a simple single\r\neye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they\r\nincrease much in size. In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis\r\nstage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed\r\nnatatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely\r\ncomplex antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and\r\ncannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search out by their\r\nwell-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers\r\nof swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo\r\ntheir final metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for\r\nlife: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again\r\nobtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their\r\ntwo eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple eye-spot.\r\nIn this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as\r\neither more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the\r\nlarval condition. But in some genera the larvae become developed into\r\nhermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called\r\ncomplemental males; and in the latter the development has assuredly been\r\nretrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time\r\nand is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other organ of importance,\r\nexcepting those for reproduction.\r\n\r\nWe are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure between the\r\nembryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at this difference as\r\nin some necessary manner contingent on growth. But there is no reason\r\nwhy, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should\r\nnot have been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion, as\r\nsoon as any part became visible. In some whole groups of animals and in\r\ncertain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo does\r\nnot at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked\r\nin regard to cuttle-fish, \"there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic\r\ncharacter is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are\r\ncompleted.\" Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having\r\ntheir proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great\r\nclasses pass through considerable and often great changes during their\r\ndevelopment. Spiders, again, barely undergo any metamorphosis. The\r\nlarvae of most insects pass through a worm-like stage, whether they are\r\nactive and adapted to diversified habits, or are inactive from being\r\nplaced in the midst of proper nutriment, or from being fed by their\r\nparents; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to\r\nthe admirable drawings of the development of this insect, by Professor\r\nHuxley, we see hardly any trace of the vermiform stage.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which fail. Thus,\r\nFritz Muller has made the remarkable discovery that certain shrimp-like\r\ncrustaceans (allied to Penoeus) first appear under the simple\r\nnauplius-form, and after passing through two or more zoea-stages, and\r\nthen through the mysis-stage, finally acquire their mature structure:\r\nnow in the whole great malacostracan order, to which these crustaceans\r\nbelong, no other member is as yet known to be first developed under the\r\nnauplius-form, though many appear as zoeas; nevertheless Muller assigns\r\nreasons for his belief, that if there had been no suppression of\r\ndevelopment, all these crustaceans would have appeared as nauplii.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology--namely, the\r\nvery general, though not universal, difference in structure between the\r\nembryo and the adult; the various parts in the same individual embryo,\r\nwhich ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes,\r\nbeing at an early period of growth alike; the common, but not\r\ninvariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most\r\ndistinct species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while\r\nwithin the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either\r\nat that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvae which\r\nhave to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted to the\r\nsurrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain larvae standing\r\nhigher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal into which\r\nthey are developed? I believe that all these facts can be explained as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the embryo\r\nat a very early period, that slight variations or individual differences\r\nnecessarily appear at an equally early period. We have little evidence\r\non this head, but what we have certainly points the other way; for it\r\nis notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and various fancy animals,\r\ncannot positively tell, until some time after birth, what will be the\r\nmerits and demerits of their young animals. We see this plainly in our\r\nown children; we cannot tell whether a child will be tall or short, or\r\nwhat its precise features will be. The question is not, at what period\r\nof life any variation may have been caused, but at what period the\r\neffects are displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe often has\r\nacted, on one or both parents before the act of generation. It deserves\r\nnotice that it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it\r\nis nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its characters\r\nare acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify,\r\nfor instance, to a bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved\r\nbeak whether or not while young it possessed a beak of this shape, as\r\nlong as it was fed by its parents.\r\n\r\nI have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any variation\r\nfirst appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age\r\nin the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding\r\nages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago\r\nstates of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle.\r\nBut variations which, for all that we can see might have appeared either\r\nearlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding\r\nage in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is\r\ninvariably the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of\r\nvariations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened\r\nat an earlier age in the child than in the parent.\r\n\r\nThese two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear\r\nat a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding\r\nnot early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading\r\nfacts in embryology. But first let us look to a few analogous cases in\r\nour domestic varieties. Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain\r\nthat the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely\r\nallied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was\r\ncurious to see how far their puppies differed from each other. I was\r\ntold by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and\r\nthis, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually\r\nmeasuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that\r\nthe puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional\r\ndifference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and\r\nrace-horses--breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection\r\nunder domestication--differed as much as the full-grown animals; but\r\nhaving had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old\r\ncolts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAs we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are\r\ndescended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons\r\nwithin twelve hours after being hatched. I carefully measured the\r\nproportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of\r\nmouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg,\r\nin the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons,\r\ncarriers, and tumblers. Now, some of these birds, when mature, differ in\r\nso extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and in other\r\ncharacters, that they would certainly have been ranked as distinct\r\ngenera if found in a state of nature. But when the nestling birds of\r\nthese several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could\r\njust be distinguished, the proportional differences in the above\r\nspecified points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds.\r\nSome characteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the\r\nwidth of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young. But there was\r\none remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced\r\ntumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the\r\nother breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThese facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers select\r\ntheir dogs, horses, pigeons, etc., for breeding, when nearly grown up.\r\nThey are indifferent whether the desired qualities are acquired earlier\r\nor later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the\r\ncases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that\r\nthe characteristic differences which have been accumulated by man's\r\nselection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear\r\nat a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not\r\nearly period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve\r\nhours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is not the\r\nuniversal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have\r\nappeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences\r\nmust have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.\r\n\r\nNow, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of nature.\r\nLet us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and\r\nmodified through natural selection for different habits. Then, from\r\nthe many slight successive variations having supervened in the several\r\nspecies at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding\r\nage, the young will have been but little modified, and they will still\r\nresemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we\r\nhave seen with the breeds of the pigeon. We may extend this view to\r\nwidely distinct structures and to whole classes. The fore-limbs, for\r\ninstance, which once served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have\r\nbecome, through a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant\r\nto act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; but on the\r\nabove two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in\r\nthe embryos of these several forms; although in each form the fore-limb\r\nwill differ greatly in the adult state. Whatever influence long\r\ncontinued use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other\r\nparts of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when\r\nnearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its\r\nown living; and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to\r\nthe offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will\r\nnot be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree, through\r\nthe effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.\r\n\r\nWith some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a\r\nvery early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at an\r\nearlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of these\r\ncases the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature parent-form,\r\nas we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is the rule of\r\ndevelopment in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone,\r\nas with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and\r\nsome members of the great class of insects. With respect to the final\r\ncause of the young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis,\r\nwe can see that this would follow from the following contingencies:\r\nnamely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for their\r\nown wants, and from their following the same habits of life with their\r\nparents; for in this case it would be indispensable for their existence\r\nthat they should be modified in the same manner as their parents. Again,\r\nwith respect to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water\r\nanimals do not undergo any metamorphosis, while marine members of the\r\nsame groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has\r\nsuggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal\r\nto live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be\r\ngreatly simplified by its not passing through any larval stage; for it\r\nis not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and\r\nmature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life, would\r\ncommonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other organisms. In this\r\ncase the gradual acquirement at an earlier and earlier age of the adult\r\nstructure would be favoured by natural selection; and all traces of\r\nformer metamorphoses would finally be lost.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow\r\nhabits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and\r\nconsequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if\r\nit profited a larva already different from its parent to change still\r\nfurther, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages,\r\nthe young or the larvae might be rendered by natural selection more and\r\nmore different from their parents to any conceivable extent. Differences\r\nin the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of\r\nits development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to\r\ndiffer greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with\r\nmany animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in\r\nwhich organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be useless; and\r\nin this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in\r\nthe young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with\r\ninheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through\r\nstages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition\r\nof their adult progenitors. Most of our best authorities are now\r\nconvinced that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have thus\r\nbeen acquired through adaptation, and not through inheritance from some\r\nancient form. The curious case of Sitaris--a beetle which passes through\r\ncertain unusual stages of development--will illustrate how this might\r\noccur. The first larval form is described by M. Fabre, as an active,\r\nminute insect, furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four\r\neyes. These larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male\r\nbees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before\r\nthe females, the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the\r\nfemales while paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits\r\nher eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvae of\r\nthe Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they undergo\r\na complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and antennae become\r\nrudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they now more closely\r\nresemble the ordinary larvae of insects; ultimately they undergo a\r\nfurther transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle. Now,\r\nif an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris, were\r\nto become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of\r\ndevelopment of the new class would be widely different from that of\r\nour existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly would not\r\nrepresent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the\r\nembryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the\r\ncondition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state. In\r\nthe great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each\r\nother, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even\r\nthe malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the nauplius-form; and\r\nas these larvae live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for\r\nany peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz\r\nMuller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent\r\nadult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently\r\nproduced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named\r\ngreat Crustacean groups. So again, it is probable, from what we know of\r\nthe embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals\r\nare the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was\r\nfurnished in its adult state with branchiae, a swim-bladder, four\r\nfin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.\r\n\r\nAs all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived,\r\ncan be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each\r\nclass have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine\r\ngradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the\r\nonly possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the\r\nhidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the\r\nterm of the Natural System. On this view we can understand how it is\r\nthat, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is\r\neven more important for classification than that of the adult. In two or\r\nmore groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other\r\nin structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through\r\nclosely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all\r\ndescended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related.\r\nThus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent; but\r\ndissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity of\r\ndescent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have been\r\nsuppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through adaptation to\r\nnew habits of life as to be no longer recognisable. Even in groups, in\r\nwhich the adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of\r\norigin is often revealed by the structure of the larvae; we have seen,\r\nfor instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish,\r\nare at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of\r\ncrustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the\r\nstructure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we\r\ncan see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their\r\nadult state the embryos of existing species of the same class. Agassiz\r\nbelieves this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope hereafter\r\nto see the law proved true. It can, however, be proved true only in\r\nthose cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group\r\nhas not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having\r\nsupervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations\r\nhaving been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first\r\nappeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be true,\r\nbut yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back\r\nin time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of\r\ndemonstration. The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in\r\nwhich an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special\r\nline of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole group\r\nof descendants; for such larval state will not resemble any still more\r\nancient form in its adult state.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which\r\nare second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of\r\nvariations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor,\r\nhaving appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been\r\ninherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises greatly in\r\ninterest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less\r\nobscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all\r\nthe members of the same great class.\r\n\r\nRUDIMENTARY, ATROPHIED, AND ABORTED ORGANS.\r\n\r\nOrgans or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain stamp of\r\ninutility, are extremely common, or even general, throughout nature. It\r\nwould be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some\r\npart or other is not in a rudimentary condition. In the mammalia, for\r\ninstance, the males possess rudimentary mammae; in snakes one lobe of\r\nthe lungs is rudimentary; in birds the \"bastard-wing\" may safely be\r\nconsidered as a rudimentary digit, and in some species the whole wing is\r\nso far rudimentary that it cannot be used for flight. What can be more\r\ncurious than the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up\r\nhave not a tooth in their heads; or the teeth, which never cut through\r\nthe gums, in the upper jaws of unborn calves?\r\n\r\nRudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in various\r\nways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied species, or even\r\nto the same identical species, which have either full-sized and perfect\r\nwings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie under\r\nwing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is\r\nimpossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary\r\norgans sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs\r\nwith the mammae of male mammals, which have been known to become well\r\ndeveloped and to secrete milk. So again in the udders of the genus Bos,\r\nthere are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats; but the\r\nlatter in our domestic cows sometimes become well developed and yield\r\nmilk. In regard to plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and\r\nsometimes well developed in the individuals of the same species. In\r\ncertain plants having separated sexes Kolreuter found that by crossing a\r\nspecies, in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil, with\r\nan hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed pistil, the\r\nrudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this\r\nclearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are essentially\r\nalike in nature. An animal may possess various parts in a perfect state,\r\nand yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for they are useless: thus\r\nthe tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt, as Mr. G.H. Lewes\r\nremarks, \"has gills, and passes its existence in the water; but the\r\nSalamandra atra, which lives high up among the mountains, brings forth\r\nits young full-formed. This animal never lives in the water. Yet if\r\nwe open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely\r\nfeathered gills; and when placed in water they swim about like the\r\ntadpoles of the water-newt. Obviously this aquatic organisation has no\r\nreference to the future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation\r\nto its embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral\r\nadaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its progenitors.\"\r\n\r\nAn organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly\r\naborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly\r\nefficient for the other. Thus, in plants, the office of the pistil is\r\nto allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the ovarium.\r\nThe pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some\r\nCompositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have\r\na rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style\r\nremains well developed and is clothed in the usual manner with hairs,\r\nwhich serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and conjoined\r\nanthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose,\r\nand be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the swim-bladder seems\r\nto be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has\r\nbecome converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. Many similar\r\ninstances could be given.\r\n\r\nUseful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we have\r\nreason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed, ought\r\nnot to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascent condition,\r\nand in progress towards further development. Rudimentary organs, on\r\nthe other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth which never cut\r\nthrough the gums, or almost useless, such as the wings of an ostrich,\r\nwhich serve merely as sails. As organs in this condition would formerly,\r\nwhen still less developed, have been of even less use than at present,\r\nthey cannot formerly have been produced through variation and\r\nnatural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful\r\nmodifications. They have been partially retained by the power of\r\ninheritance, and relate to a former state of things. It is, however,\r\noften difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs;\r\nfor we can judge only by analogy whether a part is capable of further\r\ndevelopment, in which case alone it deserves to be called nascent.\r\nOrgans in this condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus\r\nprovided will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with the\r\nsame organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have become\r\nlong ago extinct. The wing of the penguin is of high service, acting as\r\na fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wing: not\r\nthat I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a reduced organ,\r\nmodified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on the other hand,\r\nis quite useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen considers the simple\r\nfilamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the \"beginnings of organs\r\nwhich attain full functional development in higher vertebrates;\" but,\r\naccording to the view lately advocated by Dr. Gunther, they are probably\r\nremnants, consisting of the persistent axis of a fin, with the lateral\r\nrays or branches aborted. The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may\r\nbe considered, in comparison with the udders of a cow, as in a nascent\r\ncondition. The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have ceased\r\nto give attachment to the ova and are feebly developed, are nascent\r\nbranchiae.\r\n\r\nRudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very\r\nliable to vary in the degree of their development and in other respects.\r\nIn closely allied species, also, the extent to which the same organ\r\nhas been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well\r\nexemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to\r\nthe same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this\r\nimplies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent\r\nwhich analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which\r\nare occasionally found in monstrous individuals. Thus in most of\r\nthe Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may\r\nconclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is found\r\nin many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally becomes\r\nperfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common snap-dragon.\r\nIn tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same\r\nclass, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to understand the\r\nrelations of the parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments.\r\nThis is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the\r\nhorse, ox, and rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the\r\nupper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo,\r\nbut afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal\r\nrule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the embryo\r\nrelatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that the organ\r\nat this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in\r\nany degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary organs in the adult are often\r\nsaid to have retained their embryonic condition.\r\n\r\nI have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.\r\nIn reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment; for\r\nthe same reasoning power which tells us that most parts and organs are\r\nexquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness\r\nthat these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless. In\r\nworks on natural history, rudimentary organs are generally said to have\r\nbeen created \"for the sake of symmetry,\" or in order \"to complete the\r\nscheme of nature.\" But this is not an explanation, merely a restatement\r\nof the fact. Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the boa-constrictor\r\nhas rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it be said that\r\nthese bones have been retained \"to complete the scheme of nature,\" why,\r\nas Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained by other snakes,\r\nwhich do not possess even a vestige of these same bones? What would be\r\nthought of an astronomer who maintained that the satellites revolve in\r\nelliptic courses round their planets \"for the sake of symmetry,\" because\r\nthe planets thus revolve round the sun? An eminent physiologist accounts\r\nfor the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to\r\nexcrete matter in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but can we\r\nsuppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in\r\nmale flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue, can thus act?\r\nCan we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed,\r\nare beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by removing\r\nmatter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a man's fingers have been\r\namputated, imperfect nails have been known to appear on the stumps, and\r\nI could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails are developed in\r\norder to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin\r\nof the manatee have been developed for this same purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary\r\norgans is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a large extent\r\nthe laws governing their imperfect development. We have plenty of cases\r\nof rudimentary organs in our domestic productions, as the stump of a\r\ntail in tailless breeds, the vestige of an ear in earless breeds of\r\nsheep--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of\r\ncattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals--and the\r\nstate of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of\r\nvarious parts in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw\r\nlight on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further\r\nthan by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of\r\nevidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo\r\ngreat and abrupt changes. But we learn from the study of our domestic\r\nproductions that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and\r\nthat the result is inherited.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering\r\norgans rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps to the more\r\nand more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became\r\nrudimentary--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark\r\ncaverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which\r\nhave seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have\r\nultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful under\r\ncertain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the\r\nwings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case\r\nnatural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was\r\nrendered harmless and rudimentary.\r\n\r\nAny change in structure and function, which can be effected by small\r\nstages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ\r\nrendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one\r\npurpose, might be modified and used for another purpose. An organ\r\nmight, also, be retained for one alone of its former functions. Organs,\r\noriginally formed by the aid of natural selection, when rendered useless\r\nmay well be variable, for their variations can no longer be checked by\r\nnatural selection. All this agrees well with what we see under nature.\r\nMoreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or selection reduces\r\nan organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity\r\nand to exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at\r\ncorresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced state\r\nat the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the embryo. Thus\r\nwe can understand the greater size of rudimentary organs in the embryo\r\nrelatively to the adjoining parts, and their lesser relative size in the\r\nadult. If, for instance, the digit of an adult animal was used less and\r\nless during many generations, owing to some change of habits, or if an\r\norgan or gland was less and less functionally exercised, we may infer\r\nthat it would become reduced in size in the adult descendants of this\r\nanimal, but would retain nearly its original standard of development in\r\nthe embryo.\r\n\r\nThere remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has ceased being\r\nused, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be still\r\nfurther reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how can it\r\nbe finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible that disuse can go\r\non producing any further effect after the organ has once been rendered\r\nfunctionless. Some additional explanation is here requisite which I\r\ncannot give. If, for instance, it could be proved that every part of the\r\norganisation tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than\r\ntoward augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an\r\norgan which has become useless would be rendered, independently of the\r\neffects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed;\r\nfor the variations towards diminished size would no longer be checked by\r\nnatural selection. The principle of the economy of growth, explained in\r\na former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful\r\nto the possessor, are saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come\r\ninto play in rendering a useless part rudimentary. But this principle\r\nwill almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process\r\nof reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance,\r\nrepresenting in a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and\r\nformed merely of cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed\r\nfor the sake of economising nutriment.\r\n\r\nFinally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been\r\ndegraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a\r\nformer state of things, and have been retained solely through the\r\npower of inheritance--we can understand, on the genealogical view of\r\nclassification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in\r\ntheir proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary\r\nparts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high\r\nphysiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the\r\nletters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in\r\nthe pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation. On the\r\nview of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence\r\nof organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite\r\naborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly\r\ndo on the old doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated in\r\naccordance with the views here explained.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I have attempted to show that the arrangement of all\r\norganic beings throughout all time in groups under groups--that the\r\nnature of the relationships by which all living and extinct organisms\r\nare united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities\r\ninto a few grand classes--the rules followed and the difficulties\r\nencountered by naturalists in their classifications--the value set upon\r\ncharacters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high or of the\r\nmost trifling importance, or, as with rudimentary organs of no\r\nimportance--the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive\r\ncharacters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules--all\r\nnaturally follow if we admit the common parentage of allied forms,\r\ntogether with their modification through variation and natural\r\nselection, with the contingencies of extinction and divergence of\r\ncharacter. In considering this view of classification, it should be\r\nborne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used\r\nin ranking together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged\r\nvarieties of the same species, however much they may differ from each\r\nother in structure. If we extend the use of this element of descent--the\r\none certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings--we shall\r\nunderstand what is meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in\r\nits attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked\r\nby the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.\r\n\r\nOn this same view of descent with modification, most of the great facts\r\nin Morphology become intelligible--whether we look to the same pattern\r\ndisplayed by the different species of the same class in their homologous\r\norgans, to whatever purpose applied, or to the serial and lateral\r\nhomologies in each individual animal and plant.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily\r\nor generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being\r\ninherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading facts\r\nin embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual embryo\r\nof the parts which are homologous, and which when matured become\r\nwidely different in structure and function; and the resemblance of the\r\nhomologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species, though\r\nfitted in the adult state for habits as different as is possible. Larvae\r\nare active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater\r\nor less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their\r\nmodifications inherited at a corresponding early age. On these same\r\nprinciples, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size,\r\neither from disuse or through natural selection, it will generally be at\r\nthat period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and\r\nbearing in mind how strong is the force of inheritance--the occurrence\r\nof rudimentary organs might even have been anticipated. The importance\r\nof embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification\r\nis intelligible, on the view that a natural arrangement must be\r\ngenealogical.\r\n\r\nFinally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in\r\nthis chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable\r\nspecies, genera and families, with which this world is peopled, are all\r\ndescended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and\r\nhave all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without\r\nhesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts\r\nor arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
{"_id":"XV","numeral":"XV","title":" RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.","text":"CHAPTER XV. RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n Recapitulation of the objections to the theory of Natural\r\n Selection--Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances\r\n in its favour--Causes of the general belief in the immutability\r\n of species--How far the theory of Natural Selection may be\r\n extended--Effects of its adoption on the study of Natural\r\n History--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the\r\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.\r\n\r\nThat many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of\r\ndescent with modification through variation and natural selection, I do\r\nnot deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing\r\nat first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex\r\norgans and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior\r\nto, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of\r\ninnumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.\r\nNevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination\r\ninsuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following\r\npropositions, namely, that all parts of the organisation and instincts\r\noffer, at least individual differences--that there is a struggle for\r\nexistence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of\r\nstructure or instinct--and, lastly, that gradations in the state of\r\nperfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind. The\r\ntruth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what\r\ngradations many structures have been perfected, more especially among\r\nbroken and failing groups of organic beings, which have suffered much\r\nextinction; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, that we\r\nought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or\r\nany whole structure, could not have arrived at its present state by\r\nmany graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special\r\ndifficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection; and one of the\r\nmost curious of these is the existence in the same community of two\r\nor three defined castes of workers or sterile female ants; but I have\r\nattempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\r\ncrossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\r\nfertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the\r\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter, which\r\nseem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special\r\nendowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees to be\r\ngrafted together; but that it is incidental on differences confined to\r\nthe reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth\r\nof this conclusion in the vast difference in the results of crossing the\r\nsame two species reciprocally--that is, when one species is first used\r\nas the father and then as the mother. Analogy from the consideration of\r\ndimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion,\r\nfor when the forms are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed,\r\nand their offspring are more or less sterile; and these forms belong\r\nto the same undoubted species, and differ from each other in no respect\r\nexcept in their reproductive organs and functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their\r\nmongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal,\r\nthis cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the\r\nhigh authority of Gartner and Kolreuter. Most of the varieties which\r\nhave been experimented on have been produced under domestication; and as\r\ndomestication (I do not mean mere confinement) almost certainly tends\r\nto eliminate that sterility which, judging from analogy, would have\r\naffected the parent-species if intercrossed, we ought not to expect\r\nthat domestication would likewise induce sterility in their modified\r\ndescendants when crossed. This elimination of sterility apparently\r\nfollows from the same cause which allows our domestic animals to breed\r\nfreely under diversified circumstances; and this again apparently\r\nfollows from their having been gradually accustomed to frequent changes\r\nin their conditions of life.\r\n\r\nA double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the\r\nsterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring.\r\nOn the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight changes in\r\nthe conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings.\r\nWe know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same\r\nvariety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their\r\noffspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour. This\r\nis chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed\r\nto somewhat different conditions of life; for I have ascertained by a\r\nlabourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same\r\nvariety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions,\r\nthe good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly\r\ndisappears. This is one side of the case. On the other side, we know\r\nthat species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions,\r\nwhen they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed\r\nconditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile,\r\nthough retaining perfect health. This does not occur, or only in a very\r\nslight degree, with our domesticated productions, which have long been\r\nexposed to fluctuating conditions. Hence when we find that hybrids\r\nproduced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number,\r\nowing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age,\r\nor if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems\r\nhighly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact\r\nsubjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being\r\ncompounded of two distinct organisations. He who will explain in a\r\ndefinite manner why, for instance, an elephant or a fox will not breed\r\nunder confinement in its native country, whilst the domestic pig or dog\r\nwill breed freely under the most diversified conditions, will at the\r\nsame time be able to give a definite answer to the question why two\r\ndistinct species, when crossed, as well as their hybrid offspring,\r\nare generally rendered more or less sterile, while two domesticated\r\nvarieties when crossed and their mongrel offspring are perfectly\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nTurning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on\r\nthe theory of descent with modification are serious enough. All the\r\nindividuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,\r\nor even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore,\r\nin however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be\r\nfound, they must in the course of successive generations have travelled\r\nfrom some one point to all the others. We are often wholly unable even\r\nto conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason\r\nto believe that some species have retained the same specific form for\r\nvery long periods of time, immensely long as measured by years, too much\r\nstress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same\r\nspecies; for during very long periods there will always have been a good\r\nchance for wide migration by many means. A broken or interrupted range\r\nmay often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the\r\nintermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet\r\nvery ignorant as to the full extent of the various climatical and\r\ngeographical changes which have affected the earth during modern\r\nperiods; and such changes will often have facilitated migration. As an\r\nexample, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of\r\nthe Glacial period on the distribution of the same and of allied species\r\nthroughout the world. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many\r\noccasional means of transport. With respect to distinct species of the\r\nsame genus, inhabiting distant and isolated regions, as the process of\r\nmodification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration\r\nwill have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the\r\ndifficulty of the wide diffusion of the species of the same genus is in\r\nsome degree lessened.\r\n\r\nAs according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number\r\nof intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the\r\nspecies in each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties,\r\nit may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us?\r\nWhy are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable\r\nchaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we\r\nhave no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover DIRECTLY\r\nconnecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct\r\nand supplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period\r\nremained continuous, and of which the climatic and other conditions of\r\nlife change insensibly in proceeding from a district occupied by one\r\nspecies into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we\r\nhave no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in\r\nthe intermediate zones. For we have reason to believe that only a few\r\nspecies of a genus ever undergo change; the other species becoming\r\nutterly extinct and leaving no modified progeny. Of the species which do\r\nchange, only a few within the same country change at the same time;\r\nand all modifications are slowly effected. I have also shown that\r\nthe intermediate varieties which probably at first existed in the\r\nintermediate zones, would be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms\r\non either hand; for the latter, from existing in greater numbers,\r\nwould generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the\r\nintermediate varieties, which existed in lesser numbers; so that\r\nthe intermediate varieties would, in the long run, be supplanted and\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nOn this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting\r\nlinks, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at\r\neach successive period between the extinct and still older species, why\r\nis not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does\r\nnot every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the\r\ngradation and mutation of the forms of life? Although geological\r\nresearch has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links,\r\nbringing numerous forms of life much closer together, it does not yield\r\nthe infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species\r\nrequired on the theory, and this is the most obvious of the many\r\nobjections which may be urged against it. Why, again, do whole groups\r\nof allied species appear, though this appearance is often false, to have\r\ncome in suddenly on the successive geological stages? Although we\r\nnow know that organic beings appeared on this globe, at a period\r\nincalculably remote, long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system\r\nwas deposited, why do we not find beneath this system great piles\r\nof strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian\r\nfossils? For on the theory, such strata must somewhere have been\r\ndeposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nI can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition\r\nthat the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists\r\nbelieve. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as\r\nnothing compared with the countless generations of countless species\r\nwhich have certainly existed. The parent form of any two or more species\r\nwould not be in all its characters directly intermediate between\r\nits modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is directly\r\nintermediate in crop and tail between its descendants, the pouter and\r\nfantail pigeons. We should not be able to recognise a species as the\r\nparent of another and modified species, if we were to examine the two\r\never so closely, unless we possessed most of the intermediate links;\r\nand owing to the imperfection of the geological record, we have no just\r\nright to expect to find so many links. If two or three, or even more\r\nlinking forms were discovered, they would simply be ranked by many\r\nnaturalists as so many new species, more especially if found in\r\ndifferent geological substages, let their differences be ever so slight.\r\nNumerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably\r\nvarieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links\r\nwill be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide whether\r\nor not these doubtful forms ought to be called varieties? Only a small\r\nportion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings\r\nof certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least\r\nin any great number. Many species when once formed never undergo any\r\nfurther change but become extinct without leaving modified descendants;\r\nand the periods during which species have undergone modification, though\r\nlong as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with\r\nthe periods during which they retained the same form. It is the dominant\r\nand widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and\r\nvarieties are often at first local--both causes rendering the discovery\r\nof intermediate links in any one formation less likely. Local\r\nvarieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are\r\nconsiderably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are\r\ndiscovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created\r\nthere, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have\r\nbeen intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration has probably\r\nbeen shorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive\r\nformations are in most cases separated from each other by blank\r\nintervals of time of great length, for fossiliferous formations\r\nthick enough to resist future degradation can, as a general rule, be\r\naccumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed\r\nof the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary\r\nlevel the record will generally be blank. During these latter periods\r\nthere will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during\r\nperiods of subsidence, more extinction.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of strata rich in fossils beneath the\r\nCambrian formation, I can recur only to the hypothesis given in the\r\ntenth chapter; namely, that though our continents and oceans have\r\nendured for an enormous period in nearly their present relative\r\npositions, we have no reason to assume that this has always been the\r\ncase; consequently formations much older than any now known may lie\r\nburied beneath the great oceans. With respect to the lapse of time not\r\nhaving been sufficient since our planet was consolidated for the assumed\r\namount of organic change, and this objection, as urged by Sir William\r\nThompson, is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced, I can only\r\nsay, firstly, that we do not know at what rate species change, as\r\nmeasured by years, and secondly, that many philosophers are not as yet\r\nwilling to admit that we know enough of the constitution of the universe\r\nand of the interior of our globe to speculate with safety on its past\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nThat the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is\r\nimperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined\r\nto admit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly\r\ndeclares that species have all changed; and they have changed in the\r\nmanner required by the theory, for they have changed slowly and in\r\na graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from\r\nconsecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to\r\neach other than are the fossils from widely separated formations.\r\n\r\nSuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties\r\nwhich may justly be urged against the theory; and I have now briefly\r\nrecapitulated the answers and explanations which, as far as I can see,\r\nmay be given. I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many\r\nyears to doubt their weight. But it deserves especial notice that\r\nthe more important objections relate to questions on which we are\r\nconfessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know\r\nall the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the\r\nmost perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied\r\nmeans of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we\r\nknow how imperfect is the Geological Record. Serious as these several\r\nobjections are, in my judgment they are by no means sufficient to\r\noverthrow the theory of descent with subsequent modification.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication\r\nwe see much variability, caused, or at least excited, by changed\r\nconditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner, that we are\r\ntempted to consider the variations as spontaneous. Variability is\r\ngoverned by many complex laws, by correlated growth, compensation,\r\nthe increased use and disuse of parts, and the definite action of the\r\nsurrounding conditions. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how\r\nlargely our domestic productions have been modified; but we may safely\r\ninfer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be\r\ninherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain the\r\nsame, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already\r\nbeen inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for\r\nan almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand we have\r\nevidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not\r\ncease under domestication for a very long period; nor do we know that\r\nit ever ceases, for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our\r\noldest domesticated productions.\r\n\r\nVariability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally\r\nexposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on\r\nthe organisation and causes it to vary. But man can and does select\r\nthe variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any\r\ndesired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or\r\npleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by\r\npreserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without any\r\nintention of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely\r\ninfluence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive\r\ngeneration, individual differences so slight as to be inappreciable\r\nexcept by an educated eye. This unconscious process of selection has\r\nbeen the great agency in the formation of the most distinct and useful\r\ndomestic breeds. That many breeds produced by man have to a large extent\r\nthe character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts\r\nwhether many of them are varieties or aboriginally distinct species.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently\r\nunder domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival\r\nof favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent\r\nStruggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of\r\nSelection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high\r\ngeometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings.\r\nThis high rate of increase is proved by calculation--by the rapid\r\nincrease of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar\r\nseasons, and when naturalised in new countries. More individuals are\r\nborn than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance may determine\r\nwhich individuals shall live and which shall die--which variety or\r\nspecies shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally\r\nbecome extinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all\r\nrespects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will\r\ngenerally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe\r\nbetween the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between\r\nthe species of the same genus. On the other hand the struggle will often\r\nbe severe between beings remote in the scale of nature. The slightest\r\nadvantage in certain individuals, at any age or during any season, over\r\nthose with which they come into competition, or better adaptation in\r\nhowever slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will, in\r\nthe long run, turn the balance.\r\n\r\nWith animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a\r\nstruggle between the males for the possession of the females. The most\r\nvigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with\r\ntheir conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success\r\nwill often depend on the males having special weapons or means of\r\ndefence or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.\r\n\r\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical\r\nchanges, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varied\r\nunder nature, in the same way as they have varied under domestication.\r\nAnd if there has been any variability under nature, it would be an\r\nunaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. It has\r\noften been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of proof, that the\r\namount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man,\r\nthough acting on external characters alone and often capriciously,\r\ncan produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere\r\nindividual differences in his domestic productions; and every one\r\nadmits that species present individual differences. But, besides such\r\ndifferences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties exist,\r\nwhich are considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record\r\nin systematic works. No one has drawn any clear distinction between\r\nindividual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly\r\nmarked varieties and subspecies and species. On separate continents, and\r\non different parts of the same continent, when divided by barriers of\r\nany kind, and on outlying islands, what a multitude of forms exist,\r\nwhich some experienced naturalists rank as varieties, others as\r\ngeographical races or sub species, and others as distinct, though\r\nclosely allied species!\r\n\r\nIf, then, animals and plants do vary, let it be ever so slightly or\r\nslowly, why should not variations or individual differences, which are\r\nin any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural\r\nselection, or the survival of the fittest? If man can by patience select\r\nvariations useful to him, why, under changing and complex conditions\r\nof life, should not variations useful to nature's living products often\r\narise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be put to this\r\npower, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole\r\nconstitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring the good\r\nand rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and\r\nbeautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life.\r\nThe theory of natural selection, even if we look no further than\r\nthis, seems to be in the highest degree probable. I have already\r\nrecapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and\r\nobjections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour\r\nof the theory.\r\n\r\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent\r\nvarieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can\r\nsee why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,\r\ncommonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,\r\nand varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary\r\nlaws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region\r\nwhere many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now\r\nflourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where\r\nthe manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a\r\ngeneral rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if\r\nvarieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger\r\ngenera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient\r\nspecies, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for\r\nthey differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the\r\nspecies of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of a larger\r\ngenera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they\r\nare clustered in little groups round other species--in both respects\r\nresembling varieties. These are strange relations on the view that each\r\nspecies was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed\r\nfirst as a variety.\r\n\r\nAs each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to\r\nincrease inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of\r\neach species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more\r\ndiversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many\r\nand widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a\r\nconstant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent\r\noffspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of\r\nmodification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of\r\nthe same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences\r\ncharacteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved\r\nvarieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less\r\nimproved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a\r\nlarge extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging\r\nto the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and\r\ndominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger,\r\nand at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups\r\ncannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them,\r\nthe more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the\r\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,\r\ntogether with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains\r\nthe arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to\r\ngroups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout\r\nall time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under\r\nwhat is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory\r\nof creation.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,\r\nfavourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications;\r\nit can act only by short and slow steps. Hence, the canon of \"Natura\r\nnon facit saltum,\" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends\r\nto confirm, is on this theory intelligible. We can see why throughout\r\nnature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity of\r\nmeans, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited, and\r\nstructures already modified in many different ways have to be adapted\r\nfor the same general purpose. We can, in short, see why nature is\r\nprodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should\r\nbe a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man\r\ncan explain.\r\n\r\nMany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How\r\nstrange it is that a bird, under the form of a woodpecker, should prey\r\non insects on the ground; that upland geese, which rarely or never swim,\r\nwould possess webbed feet; that a thrush-like bird should dive and feed\r\non sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have the habits and\r\nstructure fitting it for the life of an auk! and so in endless other\r\ncases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in\r\nnumber, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying\r\ndescendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,\r\nthese facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much\r\nbeauty throughout nature; for this may be largely attributed to the\r\nagency of selection. That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not\r\nuniversal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous\r\nsnakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted\r\nresemblance to the human face. Sexual selection has given the most\r\nbrilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males,\r\nand sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies and other\r\nanimals. With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical\r\nto the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been\r\nrendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green\r\nfoliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and\r\nfertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it comes\r\nthat certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to man and\r\nthe lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form\r\nwas first acquired, we do not know any more than how certain odours and\r\nflavours were first rendered agreeable.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves the\r\ninhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants;\r\nso that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country,\r\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and\r\nspecially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the\r\nnaturalised productions from another land. Nor ought we to marvel if all\r\nthe contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely\r\nperfect; as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be\r\nabhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of\r\nthe bee, when used against the enemy, causing the bee's own death; at\r\ndrones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and\r\nbeing then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing\r\nwaste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the\r\nqueen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within\r\nthe living bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The wonder,\r\nindeed, is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the\r\nwant of absolute perfection have not been detected.\r\n\r\nThe complex and little known laws governing the production of varieties\r\nare the same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed\r\nthe production of distinct species. In both cases physical conditions\r\nseem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much\r\nwe cannot say. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they\r\noccasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of that\r\nstation. With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have\r\nproduced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist this\r\nconclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which\r\nhas wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the\r\ndomestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is\r\noccasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually\r\nblind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the\r\nblind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With\r\nvarieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an\r\nimportant part, so that when one part has been modified other parts have\r\nbeen necessarily modified. With both varieties and species, reversions\r\nto long-lost characters occasionally occur. How inexplicable on the\r\ntheory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the\r\nshoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of\r\ntheir hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that\r\nthese species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same\r\nmanner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from\r\nthe blue and barred rock-pigeon!\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\r\nwhy should specific characters, or those by which the species of the\r\nsame genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic\r\ncharacters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour\r\nof a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if\r\nthe other species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all\r\npossessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked\r\nvarieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree\r\npermanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied\r\nsince they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters,\r\nby which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other;\r\ntherefore these same characters would be more likely again to vary than\r\nthe generic characters which have been inherited without change for an\r\nimmense period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part\r\ndeveloped in a very unusual manner in one species alone of a genus,\r\nand therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to that\r\nspecies, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on our view, this\r\npart has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common\r\nprogenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and\r\ntherefore we might expect the part generally to be still variable. But\r\na part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a\r\nbat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part\r\nbe common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited\r\nfor a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered\r\nconstant by long-continued natural selection.\r\n\r\nGlancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater\r\ndifficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural\r\nselection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We\r\ncan thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing\r\ndifferent animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have\r\nattempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on\r\nthe admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt\r\noften comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not\r\nindispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no\r\nprogeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of\r\nall the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent,\r\nand having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that\r\nallied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life,\r\nyet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and\r\ntemperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud\r\nlike our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly\r\nacquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts\r\nbeing not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing\r\nother animals to suffer.\r\n\r\nIf species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once\r\nsee why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws\r\nin their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents--in being\r\nabsorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such\r\npoints--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. This\r\nsimilarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently\r\ncreated and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme\r\ndegree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support the\r\ntheory of descent with modification. New species have come on the stage\r\nslowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change after\r\nequal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. The\r\nextinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played\r\nso conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost\r\ninevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for old\r\nforms are supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single species\r\nnor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation\r\nis once broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow\r\nmodification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after\r\nlong intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously\r\nthroughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of each formation\r\nbeing in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils\r\nin the formations above and below, is simply explained by their\r\nintermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that all\r\nextinct beings can be classed with all recent beings, naturally follows\r\nfrom the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents.\r\nAs species have generally diverged in character during their long course\r\nof descent and modification, we can understand why it is that the more\r\nancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy a\r\nposition in some degree intermediate between existing groups. Recent\r\nforms are generally looked upon as being, on the whole, higher in the\r\nscale of organisation than ancient forms; and they must be higher, in\r\nso far as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and\r\nless improved forms in the struggle for life; they have also generally\r\nhad their organs more specialised for different functions. This fact is\r\nperfectly compatible with numerous beings still retaining simple and but\r\nlittle improved structures, fitted for simple conditions of life; it is\r\nlikewise compatible with some forms having retrograded in organisation,\r\nby having become at each stage of descent better fitted for new and\r\ndegraded habits of life. Lastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance\r\nof allied forms on the same continent--of marsupials in Australia, of\r\nedentata in America, and other such cases--is intelligible, for within\r\nthe same country the existing and the extinct will be closely allied by\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nLooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been\r\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world\r\nto another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes and\r\nto the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can\r\nunderstand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the\r\ngreat leading facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so\r\nstriking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout\r\nspace, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both\r\ncases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation,\r\nand the means of modification have been the same. We see the full\r\nmeaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every traveller, namely,\r\nthat on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under\r\nheat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of\r\nthe inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they\r\nare the descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On\r\nthis same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with\r\nmodification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the\r\nidentity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on\r\nthe most distant mountains, and in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the\r\nsea in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, though separated\r\nby the whole intertropical ocean. Although two countries may present\r\nphysical conditions as closely similar as the same species ever require,\r\nwe need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different,\r\nif they have been for a long period completely sundered from each other;\r\nfor as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of\r\nall relations, and as the two countries will have received colonists at\r\nvarious periods and in different proportions, from some other country\r\nor from each other, the course of modification in the two areas will\r\ninevitably have been different.\r\n\r\nOn this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why\r\noceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why\r\nmany are peculiar or endemic forms. We clearly see why species belonging\r\nto those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of the ocean,\r\nas frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic islands; and\r\nwhy, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, animals which\r\ncan traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far distant from any\r\ncontinent. Such cases as the presence of peculiar species of bats on\r\noceanic islands and the absence of all other terrestrial mammals,\r\nare facts utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe existence of closely allied representative species in any two areas,\r\nimplies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same\r\nparent-forms formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably\r\nfind that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some\r\nidentical species are still common to both. Wherever many closely allied\r\nyet distinct species occur, doubtful forms and varieties belonging to\r\nthe same groups likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the\r\ninhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest\r\nsource whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in the\r\nstriking relation of nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands, to\r\nthe plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and of\r\nthose of the Cape de Verde Archipelago, and of the other African islands\r\nto the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no\r\nexplanation on the theory of creation.\r\n\r\nThe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can\r\nbe arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to groups,\r\nand with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent\r\ngroups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its\r\ncontingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same\r\nprinciples we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms\r\nwithin each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain\r\ncharacters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why\r\nadaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the beings, are\r\nof hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from\r\nrudimentary parts, though of no service to the beings, are often of high\r\nclassificatory value; and why embryological characters are often the\r\nmost valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings, in\r\ncontradistinction to their adaptive resemblances, are due to inheritance\r\nor community of descent. The Natural System is a genealogical\r\narrangement, with the acquired grades of difference, marked by the\r\nterms, varieties, species, genera, families, etc.; and we have to\r\ndiscover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, whatever\r\nthey may be, and of however slight vital importance.\r\n\r\nThe similar framework of bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat,\r\nfin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse--the same number of vertebrae\r\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant--and innumerable\r\nother such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent\r\nwith slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern\r\nin the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such different\r\npurpose--in the jaws and legs of a crab--in the petals, stamens, and\r\npistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent, intelligible on\r\nthe view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were\r\naboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of these classes.\r\nOn the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an\r\nearly age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of\r\nlife, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and\r\nfishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the adult forms. We\r\nmay cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird\r\nhaving branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of\r\na fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of\r\nwell-developed branchiae.\r\n\r\nDisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced\r\norgans when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of life;\r\nand we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs.\r\nBut disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it\r\nhas come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and will thus have little power on an organ during early\r\nlife; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at\r\nthis early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never\r\ncut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having\r\nwell-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature\r\nanimal were formerly reduced by disuse owing to the tongue and palate,\r\nor lips, having become excellently fitted through natural selection to\r\nbrowse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left\r\nunaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\r\nhave been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the\r\nview of each organism with all its separate parts having been specially\r\ncreated, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the plain\r\nstamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the\r\nshrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of many beetles, should\r\nso frequently occur. Nature may be said to have taken pains to\r\nreveal her scheme of modification, by means of rudimentary organs,\r\nof embryological and homologous structures, but we are too blind to\r\nunderstand her meaning.\r\n\r\nI have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have\r\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long\r\ncourse of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the natural\r\nselection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided\r\nin an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse\r\nof parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive\r\nstructures, whether past or present, by the direct action of external\r\nconditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise\r\nspontaneously. It appears that I formerly underrated the frequency\r\nand value of these latter forms of variation, as leading to permanent\r\nmodifications of structure independently of natural selection. But as my\r\nconclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated\r\nthat I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural\r\nselection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition\r\nof this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous\r\nposition--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the following words:\r\n\"I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the\r\nexclusive means of modification.\" This has been of no avail. Great is\r\nthe power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows\r\nthat fortunately this power does not long endure.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so\r\nsatisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the\r\nseveral large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been\r\nobjected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method\r\nused in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used\r\nby the greatest natural philosophers. The undulatory theory of light has\r\nthus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth on\r\nits own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct evidence.\r\nIt is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far\r\nhigher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can explain what\r\nis the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects\r\nto following out the results consequent on this unknown element of\r\nattraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of\r\nintroducing \"occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nI see no good reasons why the views given in this volume should shock\r\nthe religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how\r\ntransient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery\r\never made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also\r\nattacked by Leibnitz, \"as subversive of natural, and inferentially of\r\nrevealed, religion.\" A celebrated author and divine has written to\r\nme that \"he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a\r\nconception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms\r\ncapable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe\r\nthat He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by\r\nthe action of His laws.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent\r\nliving naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of\r\nspecies? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature\r\nare subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of\r\nvariation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear\r\ndistinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked\r\nvarieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are\r\ninvariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility\r\nis a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species\r\nwere immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history\r\nof the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have\r\nacquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume,\r\nwithout proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would\r\nhave afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had\r\nundergone mutation.\r\n\r\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one\r\nspecies has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are\r\nalways slow in admitting any great changes of which we do not see the\r\nsteps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists,\r\nwhen Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been\r\nformed, and great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see\r\nat work. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of\r\neven a million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of\r\nmany slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\r\nvolume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince\r\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of\r\nfacts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view\r\ndirectly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under\r\nsuch expressions as the \"plan of creation,\" \"unity of design,\" etc., and\r\nto think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any\r\none whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained\r\ndifficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts\r\nwill certainly reject the theory. A few naturalists, endowed with\r\nmuch flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the\r\nimmutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look\r\nwith confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will\r\nbe able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever\r\nis led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by\r\nconscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the load of\r\nprejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.\r\n\r\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that\r\na multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but\r\nthat other species are real, that is, have been independently created.\r\nThis seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that\r\na multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were\r\nspecial creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of\r\nnaturalists, and which consequently have all the external characteristic\r\nfeatures of true species--they admit that these have been produced by\r\nvariation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and slightly\r\ndifferent forms. Nevertheless, they do not pretend that they can define,\r\nor even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are\r\nthose produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa\r\nin one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning\r\nany distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will\r\nbe given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived\r\nopinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of\r\ncreation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at\r\ninnumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have\r\nbeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe\r\nthat at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were\r\nproduced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants\r\ncreated as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals,\r\nwere they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the\r\nmother's womb? Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot be\r\nanswered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a\r\nfew forms of life or of some one form alone. It has been maintained\r\nby several authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a\r\nmillion beings as of one; but Maupertuis' philosophical axiom \"of least\r\naction\" leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number; and\r\ncertainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each\r\ngreat class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of\r\ndescent from a single parent.\r\n\r\nAs a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the\r\nforegoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that\r\nnaturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have\r\nbeen much censured for having thus expressed myself. But undoubtedly\r\nthis was the general belief when the first edition of the present work\r\nappeared. I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of\r\nevolution, and never once met with any sympathetic agreement. It is\r\nprobable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either\r\nsilent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to\r\nunderstand their meaning. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost\r\nevery naturalist admits the great principle of evolution. There are,\r\nhowever, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth,\r\nthrough quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms.\r\nBut, as I have attempted to show, weighty evidence can be opposed to the\r\nadmission of great and abrupt modifications. Under a scientific point of\r\nview, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage\r\nis gained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an\r\ninexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old\r\nbelief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of\r\nspecies. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct\r\nthe forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of\r\ncommunity of descent become fewer in number and less in force. But some\r\narguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of\r\nwhole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all\r\ncan be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups.\r\nFossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between\r\nexisting orders.\r\n\r\nOrgans in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor\r\nhad the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some\r\ncases implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.\r\nThroughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same\r\npattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each\r\nother. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with\r\nmodification embraces all the members of the same great class or\r\nkingdom. I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or\r\nfive progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\r\n\r\nAnalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\r\nanimals and plants are descended from some one prototype. But analogy\r\nmay be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in\r\ncommon, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their\r\nlaws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences. We see\r\nthis even in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly\r\naffects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly\r\nproduces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. With all\r\norganic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual\r\nreproduction seems to be essentially similar. With all, as far as is at\r\npresent known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all\r\norganisms start from a common origin. If we look even to the two main\r\ndivisions--namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms--certain\r\nlow forms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have\r\ndisputed to which kingdom they should be referred. As Professor Asa Gray\r\nhas remarked, \"the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the\r\nlower algae may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and\r\nthen an unequivocally vegetable existence.\" Therefore, on the principle\r\nof natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem\r\nincredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals\r\nand plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must\r\nlikewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this\r\nearth may be descended from some one primordial form. But this inference\r\nis chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it\r\nbe accepted. No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has urged, that\r\nat the first commencement of life many different forms were evolved;\r\nbut if so, we may conclude that only a very few have left modified\r\ndescendants. For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members\r\nof each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, etc., we have\r\ndistinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimentary\r\nstructures, that within each kingdom all the members are descended from\r\na single progenitor.\r\n\r\nWhen the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace or when\r\nanalogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we can\r\ndimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural\r\nhistory. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at\r\npresent; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt\r\nwhether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure and I\r\nspeak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes\r\nwhether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good species\r\nwill cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be\r\neasy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from\r\nother forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the\r\ndifferences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. This\r\nlatter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is\r\nat present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms,\r\nif not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most\r\nnaturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.\r\n\r\nHereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction\r\nbetween species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are\r\nknown, or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate\r\ngradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without\r\nrejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate\r\ngradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more\r\ncarefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between\r\nthem. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be\r\nmerely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and\r\nin this case scientific and common language will come into accordance.\r\nIn short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\r\nnaturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial\r\ncombinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect;\r\nbut we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered\r\nand undiscoverable essence of the term species.\r\n\r\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise\r\ngreatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists, of affinity,\r\nrelationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive\r\ncharacters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be\r\nmetaphorical and will have a plain signification. When we no longer look\r\nat an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly\r\nbeyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature\r\nas one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex\r\nstructure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each\r\nuseful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical\r\ninvention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason,\r\nand even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each\r\norganic being, how far more interesting--I speak from experience--does\r\nthe study of natural history become!\r\n\r\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the\r\ncauses and laws of variation, on correlation, on the effects of use and\r\ndisuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth.\r\nThe study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new\r\nvariety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting\r\nsubject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of\r\nalready recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as\r\nthey can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be\r\ncalled the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt\r\nbecome simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no\r\npedigree or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace\r\nthe many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by\r\ncharacters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary\r\norgans will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost\r\nstructures. Species and groups of species which are called aberrant, and\r\nwhich may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a\r\npicture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will often reveal to us\r\nthe structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,\r\nand all the closely allied species of most genera, have, within a not\r\nvery remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated\r\nfrom some one birth-place; and when we better know the many means\r\nof migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will\r\ncontinue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the\r\nland, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner\r\nthe former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at\r\npresent, by comparing the differences between the inhabitants of the\r\nsea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various\r\ninhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of\r\nimmigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\r\n\r\nThe noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection\r\nof the record. The crust of the earth, with its embedded remains, must\r\nnot be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection\r\nmade at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great\r\nfossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an\r\nunusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals\r\nbetween the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But\r\nwe shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these\r\nintervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic\r\nforms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly\r\ncontemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical\r\nspecies, by the general succession of the forms of life. As species are\r\nproduced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes,\r\nand not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of all\r\ncauses of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered\r\nand perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual\r\nrelation of organism to organism--the improvement of one organism\r\nentailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows,\r\nthat the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\r\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though not\r\nactual lapse of time. A number of species, however, keeping in a body\r\nmight remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period,\r\nseveral of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming\r\ninto competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so\r\nthat we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the future I see open fields for far more important researches.\r\nPsychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid\r\nby Mr. Herbert Spencer, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental\r\npower and capacity by gradation. Much light will be thrown on the origin\r\nof man and his history.\r\n\r\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\r\nthat each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords\r\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,\r\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants\r\nof the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those\r\ndetermining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all\r\nbeings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some\r\nfew beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system\r\nwas deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the\r\npast, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its\r\nunaltered likeness to a distinct futurity. And of the species now living\r\nvery few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;\r\nfor the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the\r\ngreater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many\r\ngenera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We\r\ncan so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it\r\nwill be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger\r\nand dominant groups within each class, which will ultimately prevail and\r\nprocreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are\r\nthe lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Cambrian\r\nepoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation\r\nhas never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the\r\nwhole world. Hence, we may look with some confidence to a secure future\r\nof great length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the\r\ngood of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to\r\nprogress towards perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many\r\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\r\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,\r\nand to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different\r\nfrom each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,\r\nhave all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in\r\nthe largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is\r\nalmost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct\r\naction of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of\r\nIncrease so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence\r\nto Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the\r\nExtinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from\r\nfamine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of\r\nconceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly\r\nfollows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms\r\nor into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according\r\nto the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms\r\nmost beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF THE PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC TERMS USED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME.\r\n\r\n(I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W.S. Dallas for this Glossary,\r\nwhich has been given because several readers have complained to me\r\nthat some of the terms used were unintelligible to them. Mr. Dallas has\r\nendeavoured to give the explanations of the terms in as popular a form\r\nas possible.)\r\n\r\nABERRANT.--Forms or groups of animals or plants which deviate in\r\nimportant characters from their nearest allies, so as not to be easily\r\nincluded in the same group with them, are said to be aberrant.\r\n\r\nABERRATION (in Optics).--In the refraction of light by a convex lens the\r\nrays passing through different parts of the lens are brought to a focus\r\nat slightly different distances--this is called SPHERICAL ABERRATION; at\r\nthe same time the coloured rays are separated by the prismatic action of\r\nthe lens and likewise brought to a focus at different distances--this is\r\nCHROMATIC ABERRATION.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL.--Contrary to the general rule.\r\n\r\nABORTED.--An organ is said to be aborted, when its development has been\r\narrested at a very early stage.\r\n\r\nALBINISM.--Albinos are animals in which the usual colouring matters\r\ncharacteristic of the species have not been produced in the skin and its\r\nappendages.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"}
